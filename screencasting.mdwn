For <http://www.youtube.com/webconverger/> we've made a couple of videos to
show users around Webconverger.

Our video camera is a Iphone 4S with a generic plastic iphone4 and tripod to
keep the "video camera" steady.

For editing we are using Imovie '11 (9.0.4) on a MBP.

# Screencasting

Surprisingly screencasting is a dark art.

# MacOSX

Although [vlc](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/) can capture screen:// we found it
unstable, so we forked out 20USD for <http://shinywhitebox.com/ishowu-v1/>

The tricky thing here was setting up the preset as the same size as the full
size screen.

# Windows

I did try [CamStudio](http://camstudio.org) but it had some bugs like not being
able to stop a record once minimised and not detecting that I dropped to a
lower 800x600 resolution.

After [studying
Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_screencasting_software) I
found [Active Presenter Free edition](http://atomisystems.com/) and downloaded it.

"Smart Capture" looks cool, but it did some weird things so I ended with Full
Motion with 1024x768.

Next problem is importing the Exported AVI file to Imovie. By default the
exported ActivePresenter MP4/AVI files are greyed out, since they are not in
the correct format. Here I copied the file to my Linux machine and ran
[HandBrake](http://handbrake.fr/):

	HandBrakeCLI -i windows-usb.avi -o windows-usb-able-to-be-imported.mp4

Now the resulting file can be imported into Imovie on the MBP. A Windows, Linux
& Mac effort!

# Imovie

When importing videos, the Inspector tool's Normalize Clip Volume in the Audio
tab and Enhance to reduce background noise are its killer features.
