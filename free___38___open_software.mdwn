Webconverger is 'opensource' software using Debian packages, where the [Debian social contract](http://www.debian.org/social_contract) applies. Even the build process is free software. It does unfortunately include the non-free software [[Adobe]] Flash.

Apple MacOSX has some Free software under the hood and a Free rendering engine Webkit. Well done Apple, though everything open source would be far better.
