Webconverger currently ships with the latest Web standards compliant [Firefox](http://en.www.mozilla.com/en/firefox/)/[Iceweasel](http://packages.qa.debian.org/i/iceweasel.html) 3 by default.

## Reasons not use Internet Explorer (IE)

* IE 7 is slow (couple of seconds to open a new tab)
* IE 7 still has many many CSS errors
* IE 7 still doesn't support the W3C DOM
