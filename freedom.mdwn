Webconverger is 'opensource' software using Debian packages, where the [Debian social contract](http://www.debian.org/social_contract) applies. Even the build process is free software. It does unfortunately include the non-free software [[Adobe]] Flash in the [package list](http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/debian-live/configs/webconverger/config/chroot_localpackageslists/webconverger?op=file&rev=0&sc=0).

There is a 100% Free software version of Webconverger in the **noflash** section in [http://download.webconverger.com/noflash/](http://download.webconverger.com/noflash/)

Apple MacOSX has some Free software under the hood and a Free rendering engine Webkit. Well done Apple, though everything open source would be far better.
