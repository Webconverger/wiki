Microsoft Vista has very high system requirements and poor hardware compatibility.

MacOSX require their own particular Apple hardware.

Webconverger can run on most PCs that meet [Firefox's minimum requirements](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/system-requirements.html). In fact Webconverger does not require any hard drive (free disk space).

Webconverger can run well on __recycled machines__. Pentium 3s with 128MB of RAM are quite suitable PCs for Webconverger.

Webconverger does have issues with hardware that requires proprietary firmware, such as **wireless network interfaces**. See [[networking]] for advice.

In the future Webconverger aims to support other architectures and devices, besides the typical PC. Everything from TVs to mobile devices will converge to the Web. Please give some feedback if you have a particular device you want to see Webconverger on.

	Anyway, if you have 64 megs ram, Firefox might fail to load or take a
	very long time to load (the screen only show static Webconverger
	wallpaper, while the CD ROM drive LED blinking). Sometimes it appears
	the X is restarted.

	You can start it just fine with 96 megs of RAM! So, think this is the
	lowest RAM requirement. But keep in mind that it might take a long
	time to boot..

	Anyway, I just noticed that my CPU actually a Pentium II 233 Mhz :-)
