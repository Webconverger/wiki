	By the way Webconverger is really cool because we used SiteKiosk under Windows
	and the performance on our old terminals was terrible since we got a new
	homepage... there was to much unused operating system trash running in the
	background which slowed down our terminals.

Microsoft Vista has very high system requirements and poor hardware compatibility.

MacOSX / Chromium OS require their own particular hardware.

Webconverger can run on most PCs that meet [Firefox's minimum
requirements](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/system-requirements.html).

Webconverger has been even known to run on Pentium 3, though [[Adobe|Flash]]
should be disabled in such daring [re-uses of old computers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_recycling).

In fact Webconverger **does not require any hard drive**, if you boot from a [[USB]] stick.

Webconverger can run well on **older machines** that can USB boot. Give Webconverger a try!
