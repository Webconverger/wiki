[[!meta title="Tips for debugging"]]

Append `debug` on the boot command line, in order to access a default instance
of the [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/tutorial) window manager.

* [Debug example of the Live version](http://r2d2.webconverger.org/2012-11-05/debug.html)

# Details about the browser build

`about:support` on the URL bar.

# Using Firefox without the locked down Webconverger extension

	chrome=debug

# Setting root password

<http://r2d2.webconverger.org/2013-03-15/setting-root-password-guide.html>

# Remote logging

Use the `log=` [[API]] and grab an account with [Papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com/?thank=97e900) for a nice Web interface

# Breaking install boot

Hold Alt or Shift keys on the install boot to get `boot:` prompt

Also see: <https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/issues/107>

# Doing compiles

You need to remove `/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/exclude-files` to get your headers, before installing `build-essential` et al.

# Pastebin

As the root _super-user_ `sudo -i`, utilise the `p` tool to paste you logs into.

* Implented in <https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/root/.bashrc>
* Example: `grep upgrade.sh /var/log/daemon.log | p`

# Disable upgrades

Booting Webconverger by default will forcefully fast forward to <https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commits/master>

You probably don't want this behaviour if you are testing a change, so append `noupgrade`.

# Monitoring network bandwidth

	# cat /proc/net/netstat | p

Useful for calculating rough sizes of upgrades.

# Debugging shell scripts

Putting at the top of your script

	exec >/tmp/${0}$$.log 2>&1
	set -x

Creates a complete log file in /tmp

# Taking a screenshot

Boot with `debug` in cmdline and as root `sudo -i`.

	apt-get update && apt-get install scrot suckless-tools

Using dwm's default dmenu shortcut, [Alt]+p and choosing scrot and append the
filename, like `/tmp/test-rendering.png`

From there you can use <http://imgur.com/> to upload the PNG file and get the URL to paste into a bug report.

# Tweaking webc.sh ?

You can edit things and restart X by running `pkill X` as root.

# Debugging configuration caching

Assuming you have a configuration like so <http://dabase.com/blog/Sharing_an_Internet_connection_in_Archlinux/>

Setup Virtualbox with the Bridged Adaptor **eth0**.

To disable access to the configuration server:

	iptables -I FORWARD 1 -d config.webconverger.com -j REJECT

To clear the above rule:

	iptables -F FORWARD
