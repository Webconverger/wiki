[[!meta title="Tips for debugging"]]

Append `debug` on the boot command line, in order to access a default instance
of the [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/tutorial) window manager.

`about:support` on the URL bar.

As root user, use the p function to export your clipboard to a URL.

Use the `log=` API however this only comes online during live-config atm.

# Breaking install boot

Hold Alt or Shift keys on boot to get `boot:` prompt

# Disable upgrades

Booting Webconverger by default will forcefully fast forward to <https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commits/master>

You probably don't want this behaviour if you are testing a change, so append `noupgrade`.

# Taking a screenshot

Boot with `debug` in cmdline and as root `sudo -i`.

	apt-get update && apt-get install scrot suckless-tools

Using dwm's default dmenu shortcut, `^p` and choosing scrot and append the filename, like `/tmp/test-rendering.png`

From there you can use <http://imgur.com/> to upload the PNG file and get the URL to paste into a bug report.
