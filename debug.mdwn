[[!meta title="Tips for debugging"]]

Append `debug` on the boot command line, in order to access a default instance
of the [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/tutorial) window manager.

* [Debug example of the Live version](http://r2d2.webconverger.org/2012-11-05/debug.html)

# Details about the browser build

`about:support` on the URL bar.

# Using Firefox without the locked down Webconverger extension

	chrome=debug

# Remote logging

Use the `log=` [[API]] and grab an account with [Papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com/?thank=97e900) for a nice Web interface

# Breaking install boot

Hold Alt or Shift keys on the install boot to get `boot:` prompt

# Pastebin

As the root _super-user_ `sudo -i`, utilise the `p` tool to paste you logs into.

* Implented in <https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/root/.bashrc>
* Example: `grep upgrade.sh /var/log/daemon.log | p`

# Disable upgrades

Booting Webconverger by default will forcefully fast forward to <https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commits/master>

You probably don't want this behaviour if you are testing a change, so append `noupgrade`.

# Taking a screenshot

Boot with `debug` in cmdline and as root `sudo -i`.

	apt-get update && apt-get install scrot suckless-tools

Using dwm's default dmenu shortcut, [Alt]+p and choosing scrot and append the
filename, like `/tmp/test-rendering.png`

From there you can use <http://imgur.com/> to upload the PNG file and get the URL to paste into a bug report.

# Tweaking webc.sh ?

You can edit things and restart X by running `pkill X` as root.

# Any other ideas how to make debugging easier?
