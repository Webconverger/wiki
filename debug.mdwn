[[!meta title="Tips for debugging"]]

Append `debug` on the boot command line, in order to access a default instance
of the [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/tutorial) window manager.

# Details about the browser build

`about:support` on the URL bar.

# Remote logging

Use the `log=` [[API]]

# Breaking install boot

Hold Alt or Shift keys on boot to get `boot:` prompt

# Pastebin

As the root _super-user_ `sudo -i`, utilise the `p` tool to paste you logs into.

* Example: `grep upgrade.sh /var/log/daemon.log | p`

# Disable upgrades

Booting Webconverger by default will forcefully fast forward to <https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commits/master>

You probably don't want this behaviour if you are testing a change, so append `noupgrade`.

# Taking a screenshot

Boot with `debug` in cmdline and as root `sudo -i`.

	apt-get update && apt-get install scrot suckless-tools

Using dwm's default dmenu shortcut, [Alt]+p and choosing scrot and append the
filename, like `/tmp/test-rendering.png`

From there you can use <http://imgur.com/> to upload the PNG file and get the URL to paste into a bug report.
