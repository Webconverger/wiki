[[!meta title="Tips for debugging"]]

Append `debug` on the boot command line, in order to access a default instance
of the [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/tutorial) window manager.

# Getting a terminal
Once X is booted, press [shift+alt+enter together](http://dwm.suckless.org/tutorial) to make [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/) (the window manager) launch a terminal emulator.

Alternatively, you can press ctrl+alt+F2 to switch out of X to tty2 and log in there (root, no password). This also works if X didn't start.

This only works when `debug` is on the commandline.

`about:support` on the URL bar.

# Using Firefox without the locked down Webconverger extension

	chrome=debug

# Setting root password

# Remote logging

Use the `log=` [[API]] and grab an account with [Papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com/?thank=97e900) for a nice Web interface

# Debugging an installed version of Webconverger

Hold Alt or Shift keys on the install boot to get `boot:` prompt

This will not work if `noescape` is being used beforehand.

# Doing compiles

You need to remove `/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/exclude-files` to get your headers, before installing `build-essential` et al.

# Pastebin

As the root _super-user_ `sudo -i`, utilise the `p` tool to paste you logs into.

* Example: `grep upgrade.sh /var/log/daemon.log | p`

# Disable upgrades

Booting Webconverger by default will forcefully fast forward to <https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commits/master>

You probably don't want this behaviour if you are testing a change, so append `noupgrade`.

# Monitoring network bandwidth

	# cat /proc/net/netstat | p

Useful for calculating rough sizes of upgrades.

# Debugging shell scripts

Putting at the top of your script

	exec >/tmp/${0}$$.log 2>&1
	set -x

Creates a complete log file in /tmp

# Taking a screenshot

Boot with `debug` in cmdline and as root `sudo -i`.

	apt-get update && apt-get install scrot suckless-tools

Using dwm's default dmenu shortcut, [Alt]+p and choosing scrot and append the
filename, like `/tmp/test-rendering.png`

From there you can use <http://imgur.com/> to upload the PNG file and get the URL to paste into a bug report.

# Tweaking webc.sh ?

You can edit things and restart X by running `pkill X` as root.

# Debugging configuration caching

Assuming you have a configuration like so <http://dabase.com/blog/Sharing_an_Internet_connection_in_Archlinux/>

Setup Virtualbox with the Bridged Adaptor **eth0**.

To disable access to the configuration server:

	iptables -I FORWARD 1 -d config.webconverger.com -j REJECT

To clear the above rule:

	iptables -F FORWARD

# Getting support

By typing
[support](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/sbin/support) as
root, you will send your `/var/log` contents to our [support
service](http://support.webconverger.com/), which is for customers.

# Failsafe booting

Boot without "vga=771 quiet splash"

Then... you're not going to like this. Try all of these kernel cmdline options:

	memtest noapic noapm nodma nomce nolapic nomodeset nosmp nosplash vga=normal

# Debugging systemd

	systemd.confirm_spawn=1
