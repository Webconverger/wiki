The nvidia "unified" driver unfortunately doesn't have support for "legacy"
nvidia hardware. In this case, with some luck, Xorg will default to the nouveau
driver. I would be ideal if someone could confirm their old legacy nvidia
hardware does indeed correctly fall back to the nouveau driver, because I can't
test this.

It's not reasonable for me to support proprietary acceleration on
"legacy" nvidia cards since:

1. I don't have any such hardware to develop with
2. New Xorg 1.12 have a new API I've been told, which the legacy drivers will not be ported to

You can tell if your nvidia is considered a legacy device by looking
up the ids on: <https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/tree/master/usr/share/nvidia>

The nvidia hardware detection happens in
<https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc/startx.sh> because
`nvidia-xconfig` is unfortunately very stupid. I must also credit Andreas
Beckmann since his and other Debian contributors helped a lot with
<http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/pkg-nvidia/packages/nvidia-graphics-drivers/trunk/debian/>

# nvidia integration guide

There are two parts to integrating the proprietary nvidia driver:

1. the [nvidia kernel](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commit/0babb4fd12ae83a0194076c9e3469cf5c6302a0c)
2. the matching [nvidia driver component](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commit/2a5111c1498b9f117772b28cd4b5770ac996803a)

# Setting up the development environment on the target machine

To update the drivers, it's best to work from a live chroot on the target
machine, so boot into debug mode and `mount -o remount /tmp` in order to remove
the "noexec" [[security]] flag.

	# apt-get update
	# mkdir -p /var/cache/apt/archives/ /var/lib/dpkg/info
	# apt-get install linux-headers-3.2.0-2-artax1-486 build-essential

Despite the numerous apt complaints, the files are installed. It's just that
all the `/var/lib/dpkg/info` listings have [been removed in a
commit](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commit/0d80e4cd9b9f38b3764281d642e451cde7fbff6e)
to save space.

Taking screenshots are pretty useful. I recommend `apt-get install scrot dmenu`
and then taking a screen shot by using `alt+p` keystroke and typing `scrot
/tmp/a-clever-name.png`.

Next you need to download the latest nvidia driver package from their ftp site:
<ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/>

I usually copy the link and wget it into `/tmp`. This version should be later
than `modinfo nvidia | grep version:`, else you are probably wasting your time.

	/tmp# sh ./NVIDIA*.run -x

# Building the nvidia kernel module

Using the [Archlinux nvidia packaging](https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/tree/trunk/PKGBUILD?h=packages/nvidia) as a guide.

	/tmp/NVIDIA-whatever/kernel# make module
	/tmp/NVIDIA-whatever/kernel# make install

The `install` should  simply move the nvidia.ko to the right place in `/lib/modules/blah-blah/kernel/drivers/video/nvidia.ko` as the [original commit did](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commit/0babb4fd12ae83a0194076c9e3469cf5c6302a0c).

	/tmp/NVIDIA-whatever/kernel# git status

To double check that there is a `modified: ..../nvidia.ko` line

# Installing the matching nvidia driver component

Using
[nvidia-installer.log](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/var/log/nvidia-installer.log)
as a guide to running `./nvidia-installer`, install the accompanying drivers. Keep to the defaults with the dialog prompts.

Now `pkill X` and X will fail to restart. Go to another tty like `ctrl+alt+f3`
and login as root to gain a shell. Now `rmmod nvidia` should now cause the
system to insert the replacement nvidia.ko and X should just boot up again.

Confirm this is indeed the case with `modinfo nvidia | grep version:`

# Dealing with [[Adobe]] issues

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/7240670226/" title="Red&amp;blue are indeed inverted on nvidia by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7237/7240670226_031c5d187b_n.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="Red&amp;blue are indeed inverted on nvidia"></a>

As the [discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/webc-users/PI4tLA3xz_M/discussion) documents, you might notice [[adobe_flash|adobe]] with:

1. [Blue instead of yellow colours](https://bugbase.adobe.com/index.cfm?event=bug&id=3109467) aka the [smurf bug](https://bugbase.adobe.com/index.cfm?event=bug&id=3109467)
2. Instabilities

The solution is to [patch VDPAU](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/vdpau/2012-May/000022.html) or look at the wonderful [Archlinux wiki on browser plugins](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Browser_Plugins#Blue_tint_on_videos_with_flash_and_Nvidia)

The fix is introduced in <https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commit/9eba0e05b1dc900a90b997ae4a25e68f5f02f499> for example.

# Contributing back

Since the [rootfs](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc) is under git, you can
can create a commit carefully by only adding files relevant to your change and
then run `git format-patch origin` to create a encapsulated patch. To send the
patch to developers at Webconverger I recommend uploading it to your Web space
and providing a URL to it and posting to
[webc-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/webc-users) about it.
