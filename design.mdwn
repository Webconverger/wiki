Webconverger design document
============================

### Goals and principles


   1. No users - no superuser
   2. Stability & Security - based on Debian releases
   3. No local user data - Locked down browser kiosk - for example no functionality to save bookmarks locally
   4. Everything happens through the browser (for example if we need to do a HD install / network setup, through a browser, not a terminal!)
   5. Zero maintenance - Automatic update/upgrade
   6. Less is more - Minimal packages for the Web experience (though that includes Adobe flash and pdf support), though no KDE/GNOME bloat
   7. Excellent i18n support with keyboard switching
   8. (Long term) Universal commitment to all devices - Webconverger could be deployed anywhere from an office terminal to a mobile phone

### Up for debate

   1. A default Web application - for example if network wasn't found the homepage could be a standalone Python Web application to help configure the network device manually.

### Deployment options

[[template id=note text="""There is in fact too many deployment options available. Working on how which is best subset to offer professionally..."""]]

Since USB boot is poorly supported by older machines, CDROM images will probably be the most important medium. 

1. live (normal live system)
2. install (normal netinst d-i installation)
3. liveinstall (copy live system to hd)
4. hdinstall (install live system to hd)
5. [web boot](http://blog.daniel-baumann.ch/2007/09/07#20070907_debian-live-web-boot)


Most computers have hard drives, so hard installs are important. Webconverger is not the traditional thin client, as CDROM 'live's and eventually hard drive installs will not put a burden on the network or server like LTSP setups do (esp. with RAM loading "toram" in mind).

   1. Network live (could be served from a [NSLU2](http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/703708705/))
   2. **CDROM live**
   3. USB live
   4. Network live and then install to hard drive
   5. CDROM live and then install to hard drive
   6. USB live and then install to hard drive
   7. OEM installs
   8. Installs via Windows using something like [Wubi](http://wubi-installer.org/) or the [Win32 loader](http://goodbye-microsoft.com/)

Notice Webconverger Web applications can leverage the rich capabilities of Firefox with SVG graphics and the default [[fonts]].
