* No users - no superuser
* Stability & [[security]] of open source - based on GNU/Linux Debian stable releases
* No local user data - Locked down browser kiosk - for example no functionality to save bookmarks locally
* Less is more - Minimal packages for just the Web experience (though that includes [[Adobe]] flash and pdf support)
* Excellent [[internationalization_and_localization|i18n]] support
* Committed to user's [[privacy]]
* (Long term) Universal commitment to all devices - Webconverger focuses on 486 builds which should run on any PC, new or old.
* Zero maintenance - Automatic [[upgrades|upgrade]] -- this has not been achieved yet :(
