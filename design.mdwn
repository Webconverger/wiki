Webconverger design document
============================

# Goals and principles

	* No users - no superuser
	* Stability & [[security]] of open source - based on GNU/Linux Debian releases
	* No local user data - Locked down browser kiosk - for example no functionality to save bookmarks locally
	* Zero maintenance - Automatic [[upgrades]]
	* Less is more - Minimal packages for just the Web experience (though that includes [[Adobe]] flash and pdf support), though no KDE/GNOME bloat
	* Excellent [[i18n]] support
	* Committed to user's [[privacy]] and [[security]]
	* (Long term) Universal commitment to all devices - Webconverger could be deployed anywhere from an office terminal to a mobile phone
