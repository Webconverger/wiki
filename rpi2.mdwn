A curated
[auto-updating](https://github.com/Webconverger/rpi2/blob/master/usr/bin/webc-upgrade)
Archlinux Arm (alarm) rootfs <https://github.com/webconverger/rpi2> using
[webkit2gtk](http://webkitgtk.org/) based surf2 and a new [Websocket based
updater](https://github.com/Webconverger/wsc) allowing for instant updates to
the configuration and better visibility if the device is actually online.

Currently this port is designed for <abbr title="Digital Out of
Home">DOOH</abbr> / Signage applications. It can be used as a kiosk, though it
will not have a "chrome", i.e. [[user interface options|kiosk]] is set to `chrome=webcfullscreen`.

# [[API]] notes

Only a limited subset of the [[API]] is implemented. The
[webc-config](https://github.com/Webconverger/rpi2/blob/master/usr/bin/webc-config)
is the best documentation.

`instantupdate` is enabled by default, see this [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgaqofU1zgc).

You can override the browser binary `surf2` with the `webck` variable. For
example `webck=omxplayer%20-r` with
`homepage=http://techslides.com/demos/sample-videos/small.mp4` makes
Webconverger loop and play back an MP4 file.

You can power down the rpi2 with `poweroff` and reboot with `reboot`. This is
actually good practice since unfortunately the rpi2 boots from a [vfat
partition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table) that can easily
get corrupted.

To rotate the screen, you can use
`rpi2config=http://prefs.webconverger.com/2015/90-degrees.txt`.
[[xrandr|display]] commands do not work with the rpi2's framebuffer powered
display. Begin with the [canonical
config.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Webconverger/rpi2/master/boot/config.txt)
when making your changes. Other examples:

* `rpi2config=http://prefs.webconverger.com/2015/disable-overscan.txt` if your screen isn't fullscreen

# Caveats

You must have your HDMI screen on as the rpi2 boots since it does some sort of
HDMI negotiation only at boot.
