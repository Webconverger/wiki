[[!meta title="Webconverger boot options"]]

Webconverger adds a couple of extra boot parameters to [Debian Live's options](http://live.debian.net/gitweb?p=live-config.git;a=blob;f=manpages/en/live-config.7), such as homepage, wlan, http_proxy, compose, [[noblank|blanking]].

# A guide to editing the boot parameter

Editing the `/proc/cmdline` can be done by hitting TAB on the boot screen.

When the syslinux boot loader initially loads, you'll have a few seconds to
type in something at the boot: prompt. For example to get boot with [[i18n]]
French support simply append `locales=fr`.

Please see [[develop]] to make persistent changes.

### Your own homepage

Edit `homepage=`

See [[homepage]]

you can enter several homepages, which open in several tabs, separate each address with `%20` e.g. `homepage=http://portal.webconverger.com/%20http://webconverger.com`

#### Homepage MACID query

Some customers want a way of tracking which kiosks are logging in. These is best accomplished using a keyword **MACID**. For example the homepage:

	homepage=http://webconverger.com/?mac=MACID

Could be expanded to

	homepage=http://webconverger.com/?mac=08:11:96:ae:2d:3c

### Use Webconverger in German, see [[i18n]] for more localisations

append `locales=de` to setup locale and also append `keyboard-layouts=de` to setup the keyboard

### Specify a HTTP proxy at 192.168.1.5 with port 8888

append `http_proxy=http://192.168.1.5:8888`

### DEBUG MODE

remove `noroot`

Once Webconverger is booted, the [dwm window
manager](http://dwm.suckless.org/tutorial) defaults to shift+alt+enter for a
Terminal. =)

### To enable the Compose key

Add `compose`.

### [Changing chrome](https://github.com/Webconverger/Debian-Live-config/blob/master/webconverger/config/includes.chroot/home/webc/iwchromeconfig.sh)

* webcchrome=webcnoaddressbar - disable URL bar and search bar
* webcchrome=webcfullscreen - fullscreen

### Changing [closeicon](https://github.com/Webconverger/Debian-Live-config/blob/master/webconverger/config/includes.chroot/home/webc/iwcloseconfig.sh)

This a bit nitpicky, but here goes:

* closeicon=active - Close button only on the active tab, except when there is only one tab
* closeicon=activefix - Close button only on the active tab, including the last tab
* closeicon=every - Close button on every tab, except when there is only one tab
* closeicon=everyfix - Close button on every tab, even when there is only one tab
* closeicon=none - No close buttons
* closeicon=strip - Close button on the end of the tab strip

### Wireless configuration

Although wired connections are preferred, Webconverger does have
comprehensive [[support_for_wireless_devices|wireless]] and
[[blog/entry/USB_tethering]].

### Force a (lower) screen resolution of 640x480

append `xorg-resolution=640x480`
