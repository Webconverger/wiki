## Some examples of what you can customise easily

### Your own homepage

Edit `homepage=`

See [[homepage]]

(new) you can enter several homepages, which open in several tabs, e.g. `homepage=http://portal.webconverger.com/%20http://webconverger.com`

### Use Webconverger in German, see [[i18n]] for more localisations

append `locale=de`

### Specify a HTTP proxy at 192.168.1.5 with port 8888

append `http_proxy=http://192.168.1.5:8888`

### To do some debugging

remove `nosudo`

Once Webconverger is booted, the [dwm window manager](http://dwm.suckless.org/tutorial) defaults to shift+alt+enter for a Terminal. =)

### To enable the Compose key

Add `compose`

### Setup to use [[wireless]] access point "san" with WPA password "francisco"

Append `wlan=san,francisco`

### Disable ACPI (applicable to some [[odd_machines|mpc]] that fail to boot)

append `acpi=off`

### Force a screen resolution of 640x480

append `xvideomode=640x480`

### Do an [upgrade](http://git.debian.org/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=blob;f=webconverger/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/network/if-up.d/apt-upgrade;) on startup (new)

append `upgrade`

# Caveats

## usb .img

[[usb]] unfortunately does not support the GRUB boot loader currently. So you
can't customise you USB image very easily. However you can mount you USB image
and tweak your syslinux.cfg very easily by hand. Try it.

And your changes are permanent!
