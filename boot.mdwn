# A guide to editing the boot parameter

Please see [[USB]] about editing the syslinux kernel command line.

### Your own homepage

Edit `homepage=`

See [[homepage]]

(new) you can enter several homepages, which open in several tabs, e.g. `homepage=http://portal.webconverger.com/%20http://webconverger.com`

### Use Webconverger in German, see [[i18n]] for more localisations

append `locale=de`

### Specify a HTTP proxy at 192.168.1.5 with port 8888

append `http_proxy=http://192.168.1.5:8888`

### To do some debugging

remove `nosudo`

Once Webconverger is booted, the [dwm window manager](http://dwm.suckless.org/tutorial) defaults to shift+alt+enter for a Terminal. =)

### To enable the Compose key

Add `compose`

### Setup to use [[wireless]] access point "san" with WPA password "francisco"

Append `wlan=san,francisco,`

### Disable ACPI (applicable to some [[odd_machines|mpc]] that fail to boot)

append `acpi=off`

### Force a (lower) screen resolution of 640x480

append `xvideomode=640x480`

### Do an [upgrade](http://git.debian.org/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=blob;f=webconverger/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/network/if-up.d/apt-upgrade;) on startup (new)

append `upgrade`
