[[!meta title="Webconverger's boot API"]]

Webconverger heavily uses the notion of `/proc/cmdline` to control setup.
[Spaces in cmdline
values](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/993452/splitting-proc-cmdline-arguments-with-spaces)
need to be `encodeURI` in order not be considered keys themselves. For
developers, [[startup]] might better explain how these are used.

There are two ways to start using the API, firstly by hitting TAB on the boot screen.

Or by using the [configuration service](http://config.webconverger.com/) form
which you need to take a subscription out with Webconverger. The service
presents the various options below in a friendly Web form on boot, with added
persistency so your values are retained between boots once subscribed.

### Your own homepage

Edit `homepage=`

You can enter several homepages, which will open in several tabs, separate each
address with `%20` e.g.
`homepage=http://portal.webconverger.com/%20http://webconverger.com`

#### Homepage MACID query

Some customers want a way of tracking which kiosks are logging in. These is best accomplished using a keyword **MACID**. For example the homepage:

	homepage=http://webconverger.com/?mac=MACID

Could be expanded to

	homepage=http://webconverger.com/?mac=081196ae2d3c

### Use Webconverger in a different language to English

Please refer to [[i18n]]

### How to change the Webconverger branding?

Please see [[artwork]]

### Specify a HTTP proxy at 192.168.1.5 with port 8888

append `http_proxy=http://192.168.1.5:8888`

### How do I make the screen not timeout and go black?

Append `noblank`, see [[blanking]] for more.

### How do I make the screen reset after being used?

Use `kioskresetstation`, see [[blanking]] for more information

### Rotate the screen?

Study the [xrandr
manpage](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=xrandr) for commands
to setup your screen.

For example, append `xrandr=--rotate%20right`

Which equates to running `xrandr --output CONNECTED_DEVICE --rotate right` in DEBUG mode.

All video displays that xrandr sees via
[CONNECTED_DEVICE](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/home/webc/.xinitrc#L71)
are setup the same way.

### DEBUG MODE for developers

Append `debug`.

Once Webconverger is booted, the [dwm window
manager](http://dwm.suckless.org/tutorial) defaults to shift+alt+enter for a
Terminal. Gain root with `sudo -i`.

On the install version, you need to type `boot: l0 debug` to trigger debug
mode.

### Position mouse pointer (from 14.0)

	swarp=0,0

Moves the mouse cursor to the top left of the screen. This is useful when the
default cursor in the middle of the screen might accidentally trigger some
mouse over event in the Web application.

### Disable configuration service

Append `noconfig`

### How do I make the machine turn off at a set time everyday?

Set a [[cronjob]]

### Changing DNS or statically configuring the network?

Please refer to [[networking]]

### Changing [[browser_chrome|kiosk]]

* chrome=webcnoaddressbar - disable URL bar and search bar, good for [[controlled_access_setups|filtering]]
* chrome=webcfullscreen - fullscreen

### Changing [closeicon](https://github.com/Webconverger/Debian-Live-config/blob/master/webconverger/config/includes.chroot/home/webc/iwcloseconfig.sh)

This a bit nitpicky and maybe dropped from the API, but here goes:

* closeicon=active - Close button only on the active tab, except when there is only one tab
* closeicon=activefix - Close button only on the active tab, including the last tab
* closeicon=every - Close button on every tab, except when there is only one tab
* closeicon=everyfix - Close button on every tab, even when there is only one tab
* closeicon=none - No close buttons
* closeicon=strip - Close button on the end of the tab strip

### Wireless configuration

Although wired connections are preferred, Webconverger does have
comprehensive [[support_for_wireless_devices|wireless]] and
[[blog/entry/USB_tethering]].
