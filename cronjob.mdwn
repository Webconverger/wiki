Instead in investing in a 5USD [time
switch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_switch), you can statically configure
Webconverger to shutdown at a set time.

By default Webconverger boots into UTC time. Chances are you live in a
different timezone, whereby you need to study
<ftp://ftp.iana.org/tz/data/zone.tab> for the right string.

Lets pretend I live in Durban, South Africa. Even though Johannesburg isn't the
capital, I know it keeps the same time as my city, Durban.
`Africa/Johannesburg` is hence the appropriate string for describing my local
time zone.

Now I need to append that to a Webconverger [[boot]] like so:

	timezone=Africa/Johannesburg


Next we need to override `/etc/crontab` in the build.

The easiest way to do this is something like:

	echo '00 23 * * * root halt' > config/includes.chroot/etc/crontab

The second column's 23 means 11PM and combined with the earlier **timezone**
configuration, it will mean 11PM in
[SAST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Standard_Time).

You can replace `halt` with `reboot`, though there really should not be a
memory leak in Webconverger, so this is completely unnecessary.
