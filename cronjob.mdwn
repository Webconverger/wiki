[[!meta title="Scheduling a shutdown"]]

Available from [674496903d](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commit/674496903d8ec9b4eb6d1e30c92f7f784d36cf2e)

Instead in investing in a 5USD [time
switch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_switch), you can configure
Webconverger to shutdown at a set time.

Use case: Museum closes at 6pm Tuesday to Sunday (closed Mondays).
Machines are powered on manually by staff at opening time in order to be ready
and waiting for the public. Though for the convenience of staff machines
automatically turn off at 6pm sharp, closing time.

# Step 1, figure out your timezone else use UTC

By default Webconverger boots into
[synced](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc/network-up.d/ntpdate)
UTC time. Chances are you live in a timezone, whereby you need to study
<ftp://ftp.iana.org/tz/data/zone.tab> for the right string.

Lets pretend the museum is in Durban, South Africa. Even though Johannesburg
isn't the capital, I know it keeps the same time as my city, Durban.
`Africa/Johannesburg` is hence the appropriate string from
[zone.tab](ftp://ftp.iana.org/tz/data/zone.tab) for describing my local time
zone.

Now I need to append that to a Webconverger [[boot]] like so:

	timezone=Africa/Johannesburg

# Step 2, set the schedule (cron job)

The [cron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) utility is the time-based job
scheduler which unfortunately has a difficult API syntax which we make even
uglier by replacing spaces with `%20`.

To honor the above use case a crontab entry would look like:

	00 18 * * * root halt

At 6PM, as the "super user" root user, halt the machine. i.e. power down.

To pass this as a configuration to Webconverger, it needs to be encoded on [[boot]] like so:

	cron=00%2018%20*%20*%20*%20root%20halt

The script
[live-config](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commit/674496903d8ec9b4eb6d1e30c92f7f784d36cf2e#diff-5)
writes the cronjob.
