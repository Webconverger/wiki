A common feature request is for whitelisting, content filtering and censorship.

* Limit surfers to a domain (whitelisting)
* Block pornography. The TLD .xxx would be a godsend!

Preferably these requirements should be implemented separately on the gateway or proxy in your network.

## Known 3rd party appliances

* [IPCop software](http://ipcop.org/) - not an appliance I think, though perhaps you load this on an old computer?
* [SmoothWall](http://smoothwall.net/) or SmoothGuardian more specifically for content filtering

These appliances are unfortunately quite pricey. The SmoothGuardian product module with hardware is AT LEAST 3000GBP.

Cons: These appliances focus on firewalls, though Webconverger does **not** actually require a firewall for [[security]]...

## Whitelisting

Whitelisting can be done fairly easily with [tinyproxy](http://tinyproxy.sourceforge.net/). If you need whitelisting, just follow up with an email of your "white-listed" domains.

## Webconverger with OpenDNS

[OpenDNS](http://www.opendns.com/) provide a filtering service.

### Pros

* Easy to implement (no cost)
* Does not add any weight to Webconverger

### Cons

* Not really open :-)
* Not using your ISP's DNS, so quite possibly slow
* Only works on the Internet (so not good for Internal networks ... )

## Webconverger with content filtering

* [ProCon extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1803) [FTP](http://ftp.iasi.roedu.net/mirrors/mozdev.org/procon/?C=M;O=A)

For those who **really** need a basic pornography filter, this can be included in the ProCon Alba 'solution' in a special customisation.

### Cons

* Webconverger will be **slower** running these extra services
* There are always ways of getting around content filtering. e.g. Many porn Web sites do not have any text, only images.
* It is difficult to maintain and keep up to date a word list.
