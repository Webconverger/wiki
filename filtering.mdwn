# Limiting users to your Website

Firstly Webconverger needs to be [ordered](http://webconverger.com/) to be
fixed to your homepage on startup.

The problem: A common feature request is for whitelisting, content filtering and/or censorship.

* Limit surfers to a domain (whitelisting)
* Block pornography. The TLD .xxx would be a godsend!

To practically limit users to your Website, in your [customisation
order](http://webconverger.com) please specify
[[iceweasel-webcnoaddressbar|kiosk]]. This modifies the User Interface to
remove the URL addressbar, so that users can't navigate away from your homepage
easily.

Alternatively these requirements could be implemented separately on the gateway
or proxy in your network. Many good routers have blacklisting/whitelisting
capabilites.

You may also want to consider the [kiosk_reset|blanking]] feature in order to
reset Webconverger to your site every say, 3 minutes. This can help avoid
Webconverger being set on a non-mandated Website for too long in public spaces.

# Webconverger with OpenDNS

[OpenDNS](http://www.opendns.com/) provide a filtering service.

### Pros

* Easy to implement (no cost)
* Does not add any weight to Webconverger

### Cons

* Not really open :-)
* Not using your ISP's DNS, so quite possibly slow
* Only works on the Internet (so not good for Internal networks ... )
