A common feature request is for whitelisting, content filtering and censorship.

* Limit surfers to a domain (whitelisting)
* Block pornography. The TLD .xxx would be a godsend!

Preferably these requirements should be implemented separately on the gateway or proxy in your network.

## Known 3rd party appliances

* [IPCop software](http://ipcop.org/) - not an appliance I think, though perhaps you load this on an old computer?
* [SmoothWall](http://smoothwall.net/) or SmoothGuardian more specifically for content filtering

These appliances are unfortunately quite pricey. The SmoothGuardian product module with hardware is AT LEAST 3000GBP.

Cons: These appliances focus on firewalls, though Webconverger does **not** actually require a firewall for [[security]]...

## Whitelisting

Whitelisting can be done fairly easily with [[iceweasel-webcnoaddressbar|kiosk]].

## Webconverger with OpenDNS

[OpenDNS](http://www.opendns.com/) provide a filtering service.

### Pros

* Easy to implement (no cost)
* Does not add any weight to Webconverger

### Cons

* Not really open :-)
* Not using your ISP's DNS, so quite possibly slow
* Only works on the Internet (so not good for Internal networks ... )
