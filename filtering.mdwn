# Limiting users to your Website

<img src="/chrome/webcnoaddressbar.png" alt="No addressbar" />

The easiest way to limit users to your Website, in your order is to select
"User interface without URL address bar, used for limiting users to your
homepage" or the advanced API command [[chrome=webcnoaddressbar|kiosk]]. This
modifies the User Interface to remove the URL addressbar, so that users are
effectively walled into your homepage and its links.

Beware your homepage's external link might link to Google and allow that user
to browse effectively anywhere.

# NEW whitelist=

From Webconverger 25.0, you can simply have a configuration such as:

	homepage=http://www.bl.uk/
	whitelist=bl.uk

And Webconverger will be configured to expose the URL bar, so that the user can
type any URL in, as long as it matches the **bl.uk** top level domain.

To add more domains, such as flickr.com, simply append with a comma. Example:
`whitelist=bl.uk,flickr.com`. All subdomains of a whitelisted domain are
matched too. External dependencies of a page are permitted too.

# Category based filtering

Say you want to give your users free reign on the Internet, though you cannot
allow them to visit certain categories of such as adult and/or gambling sites.
In that case [please read up about our [filtering
product](http://webconverger.org/blog/2014/Fine_grained_filtering/) which
competes with [OpenDNS's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDNS) "domain blocking" product.

# How to prevent users leaving public kiosks in a "bad state"

You will want to consider the [[kiosk_reset|blanking]] options in order to
reset Webconverger to your site every say, 3 minutes. This can help avoid an
unsupervised Webconverger kiosk being set on a non-mandated Website for too
long in public spaces.

# Further un-supported options

## Using your router or wireless access point

As mentioned on <http://webconverger.org/blog/entry/Better_Routing_wanted>

3rd party firmware like [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/) provide options to
limit Internet access.

<http://www.mikrotik.com/> also supply very good flexible access point solutions.
