A **top** feature request is content filtering and censorship.

I prefer if this is implemented on the gateway with some "content filtering" appliance.


Known appliances
----------------


* [IPCop software](http://ipcop.org/) - not an appliance I think, though perhaps you load this on an old computer?
* [SmoothWall](http://smoothwall.net/) or SmoothGuardian more specifically for content filtering

These appliances are unfortunately quite pricey. The SmoothGuardian product module with hardware is AT LEAST 3000GBP.

Also a lot of these appliances provide Firewalls. Webconverger does not require a Firewall...

Why?
---------


* The main requirement is to block pornography. The TLD .xxx would be a godsend!

No requests to block 'other material' as yet...


Webconverger with in built filtering
------------------------------------


* [ProCon extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1803) [FTP](http://ftp.iasi.roedu.net/mirrors/mozdev.org/procon/?C=M;O=A)

For those who **really** need a basic pornography filter, I could include the ProCon Alba 'solution' in a customisation.

Cons
----


* Webconverger will be **slower** running these extra services
* There are always ways of getting around content filtering
* It is difficult to maintain and keep up to date
