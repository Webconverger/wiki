# Limiting users to your Website

<img src="/chrome/webcnoaddressbar.png" alt="No addressbar" />

The problem: A common feature request is for whitelisting, content filtering and/or censorship.

* Limit surfers to a domain (whitelisting)
* Block pornography. The TLD .xxx would be a godsend!

Recommended solution: To practically limit users to your Website, in your
[customisation order](http://webconverger.com) please specify
[[chrome=webcnoaddressbar|kiosk]]. This modifies the User Interface to
remove the URL addressbar, so that users can't navigate away from your
homepage.

Alternatively these requirements could be implemented separately on the gateway
or proxy in your network. Many good routers have blacklisting/whitelisting
capabilities. However these solutions and complex and never 100%.

You may also want to consider the [[kiosk_reset|blanking]] feature in order to
reset Webconverger to your site every say, 3 minutes. This can help avoid
Webconverger being set on a non-mandated Website for too long in public spaces.

# Using a 3rd party DNS

[OpenDNS](http://www.opendns.com/) provide a comprehensive [filtering service](http://www.opendns.com/web-filtering/).

[Case studies](http://www.opendns.com/resources/customer-showcase/#tab=case-study)

You can open an account with them directly or go through Webconverger.com's
sales who are resellers of the product. They can generally get a better deal
for you per seat because we buy OpenDNS services in blocks.

Using the `dns=` [[API]]

# Further un-supported options

## Using your router or wireless access point

As mentioned on <http://webconverger.org/blog/entry/Better_Routing_wanted>

3rd party firmware like [dd-wrt](http://www.dd-wrt.com) provide options to
limit WAN access under Access Restrictions to:

* Website Blocking by URL Address
* Website Blocking by Keyword

## Webconverger and IPCop

[IPCop](http://www.ipcop.org/) is a lfs-based firewall which can easily be tweaked up to an url-filter.

### Pros

* Easy to implement (no cost)
* Does not add any weight to Webconverger
* Secures your whole network from the Internet
* Very user-friendly and task-based GUI
* Great community behind the project

### Cons

* An additional PC must be installed
* Networkinterfaces must be separated physically
* No multi-WAN connections
* AddOns can only be installed by using a shell

Here are two links when you have questions about IPCop.
