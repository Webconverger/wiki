# Limiting users to your Website

<img src="/chrome/webcnoaddressbar.png" alt="No addressbar" />

The easiest way to limit users to your Website, in your [customisation
order](http://webconverger.com) please specify
[[chrome=webcnoaddressbar|kiosk]]. This modifies the User Interface to remove
the URL addressbar, so that users can't navigate away from your homepage.

# Simple filtering with the hosts= API

Using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)">the hosts file</a> is
a very simple way of filtering Web access of your Webconverger deployments.
It's by no means fool-proof, and you need to be able to create the file
yourself for the time being on a public URL since we don't offer a
configuration Web user-interface for it atm.

This feature was introduced in
[839dde](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commit/839dde7388bbf1a466191ca28d72b4419d17ad39)
and if you are using the install version, you will automatically just get this.

Note the hosts file is only setup on boot, so if you change the `hosts=` file
you need to reboot the machine for it to take affect of any modified rules.

WARNING: If the hosts file fails to retrieve, the machine can be left
unprotected. We will make this feature more failsafe, i.e. if the hosts file
fails to download, it will show a graphic to that affect and halt.

## iptables API

From Webconverger 18 there is a simple [iptables API](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commit/68b8445a0e919641d7ecdf24eca7352d47bdb77e).

[Iptables man page](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=iptables)

E.g. to block the IP 8.8.8.8

	iptables=-I%20INPUT%20-s%208.8.8.8%20-j%20DROP

You can have multiple iptables= commands and they will be processed in order.

## Blacklist

Specifying `hosts=http://example.webconverger.com/blacklist` will replace <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)">/etc/hosts</a> with the black
list <http://example.webconverger.com/blacklist>.

To attempt to blacklist for example reddit.com, you would typically add lines
in this format:

	255.255.255.255 reddit.com
	255.255.255.255 www.reddit.com

Therefore the machine would be blacklisted to surf upon reddit.com, however's
reddit's content might be available through other websites or subdomains so
this method is not fool-proof. However for simple filtering, it may just
suffice.

## Whitelist

To setup a simple [whitelist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitelist) where
only sites you specify can be accessed since the DNS service is disabled, your
`hosts=` value must contain the word **whitelist**.

For example: hosts=http://example.webconverger.com/whitelist

<http://example.webconverger.com/whitelist> contains the
sites you explicitly want to resolve/allow.

# How to prevent users leaving public kiosks in a "bad state"

You will want to consider the [[kiosk_reset|blanking]] options in order to
reset Webconverger to your site every say, 3 minutes. This can help avoid an
unsupervised Webconverger kiosk being set on a non-mandated Website for too
long in public spaces.

# OpenDNS alternative

We are working on an OpenDNS alternative. Do enquire to learn more.

# Further un-supported options

## Using your router or wireless access point

As mentioned on <http://webconverger.org/blog/entry/Better_Routing_wanted>

3rd party firmware like [dd-wrt](http://www.dd-wrt.com) provide options to
limit WAN access under Access Restrictions to:

* Website Blocking by URL Address
* Website Blocking by Keyword

## Webconverger and IPCop

[IPCop](http://www.ipcop.org/) is a lfs-based firewall which can easily be tweaked up to an url-filter.

### Pros

* Easy to implement (no cost)
* Does not add any weight to Webconverger
* Secures your whole network from the Internet
* Very user-friendly and task-based GUI
* Great community behind the project

### Cons

* An additional PC must be installed
* Networkinterfaces must be separated physically
* No multi-WAN connections
* AddOns can only be installed by using a shell

Here are two links when you have questions about IPCop.
