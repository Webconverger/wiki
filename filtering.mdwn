# Limiting users to your Website

<img src="/chrome/webcnoaddressbar.png" alt="No addressbar" />

The easiest way to limit users to your Website, in your [customisation
order](http://webconverger.com) please specify
[[chrome=webcnoaddressbar|kiosk]]. This modifies the User Interface to remove
the URL addressbar, so that users can't navigate away from your homepage.

# hosts= API

Using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)">the hosts file</a> is
a very simple way of filtering Web access of your Webconverger deployments.
It's by no names means fool-proof, and you need to be able to create the file
yourself for the time being.

This feature was introduced in
<https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commit/839dde7388bbf1a466191ca28d72b4419d17ad39>
and if you are using the install version, you will automatically just get this.

## Blacklist

Specifying `hosts=http://example.webconverger.com/blacklist` will replace <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)">/etc/hosts</a> with the black list <http://example.webconverger.com/blacklist>.

To blacklist for example reddit.com, you would add a line in this format:

	255.255.255.255 reddit.com

## Whitelist

To setup a simple whitelist your `hosts=` value must contain the word "whitelist".

For example: hosts=http://example.webconverger.com/whitelist

<http://example.webconverger.com/whitelist> is a whitelist that contains the
sites you explicitly want to resolve.

# How to prevent users leaving kiosks in a "bad state"

You will want to consider the [[kiosk_reset|blanking]] options in order to
reset Webconverger to your site every say, 3 minutes. This can help avoid
Webconverger being set on a non-mandated Website for too long in public spaces.

# Using a 3rd party DNS

[OpenDNS](http://www.opendns.com/) provide a comprehensive [filtering
service](http://www.opendns.com/web-filtering/). [Case
studies](http://www.opendns.com/resources/customer-showcase/#tab=case-study).

You can open an account with OpenDNS directly or go through Webconverger.com's
sales who are resellers of the product. sales@webconverger.com can generally
get a better deal for you per seat because we buy OpenDNS services in blocks.

This uses the `dns=` [[API]]

# Further un-supported options

## Using your router or wireless access point

As mentioned on <http://webconverger.org/blog/entry/Better_Routing_wanted>

3rd party firmware like [dd-wrt](http://www.dd-wrt.com) provide options to
limit WAN access under Access Restrictions to:

* Website Blocking by URL Address
* Website Blocking by Keyword

## Webconverger and IPCop

[IPCop](http://www.ipcop.org/) is a lfs-based firewall which can easily be tweaked up to an url-filter.

### Pros

* Easy to implement (no cost)
* Does not add any weight to Webconverger
* Secures your whole network from the Internet
* Very user-friendly and task-based GUI
* Great community behind the project

### Cons

* An additional PC must be installed
* Networkinterfaces must be separated physically
* No multi-WAN connections
* AddOns can only be installed by using a shell

Here are two links when you have questions about IPCop.
