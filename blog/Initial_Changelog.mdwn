	* I blame Debian's #424224 for my terrible changelog editing
	* Earlier I forgot to mention I updated dwm
	* And managed to get exotic hangul fonts working with it
	* Though Webconverger will target locales as it is too tricky to support
	all at one time. People could get confused with keyboard switching for 
	example and of course there is the small extensions issue with the
	browser...
	* New progress bar http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/510000876/

	* Tried out a i18n build (1.0) of WC&iceweasel
	  Many extensions seriously degrade FF's preformance
