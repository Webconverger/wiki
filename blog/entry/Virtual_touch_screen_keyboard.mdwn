A popular requested feature on the [[todo_list|todo]] is a virtual keyboard.

I'm not entirely sure if customers need a [virtual keyboard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_keyboard) for systems with a [touch
screen](http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/12/15/1614205)
interface, or meant for simpler kiosk configurations **without a keyboard**.

[[Thanks|acknowledgements]] to a discussion with an old friend Teemu Hukkanen, I have some findings to share.

Lets start with the [Debian
packaged](http://packages.qa.debian.org/x/xvkbd.html)
[xvkbd](http://freshmeat.net/projects/xvkbd/). I tried this with mine and
Webc's [light window manager dwm](http://www.suckless.org/dwm/) and it simply
wasn't able to send keyboard events to the next tiled window. I'm not sure how
the keyboard is supposed to slide in and out either from the browser pane.

[kvkbd](http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php/Kvkbd?content=56019) is the (sic) KDE
version of this tool and since I hate KDE and Gnome and it's bloatware
dependencies... that's not going in Webconverger no matter how great it is.

Maemo is interesting as [Maemo should get a GSM stack soon with
Fremantle](http://wiki.maemo.org/Task:Maemo_roadmap/Fremantle) and er... it has
and onscreen keyboard called [Hildon Input
Method](http://live.gnome.org/Hildon/HildonInputMethod). I think this may have
been [incorporated into
Ubuntu](https://code.launchpad.net/~mdamt/+junk/hildon-input-method-framework)...
I'm not sure. Still the [Hildon
framework](http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=fSo5r9NuhCY) seems pretty complicated!

Some [Brasilian dude cooked up a touch screen
keyboard](http://blog.gustavobarbieri.com.br/2007/07/24/iphone-like-virtual-keyboard-for-n800/)
which looks good and fast. I think he calls it
[vkbd](http://barbieri-playground.googlecode.com/svn/efl-tests/vkbd/). On first
glances it looks far too hildon **maemo** specific.

The [matchbox keyboard](http://packages.qa.debian.org/m/matchbox-keyboard.html)
looks terrible in Debian (and didn't work in dwm like xvkbd above), though
functioned great in Ubuntu. In Ubuntu it seems to be confused with [moblin
keyboard
manager](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/moblin-keyboard-manager).I need
to look into [Ubuntu MID for Netbooks](http://www.ubuntu.com/products/mobile).

[Florence Virtual Keyboard](http://florence.sourceforge.net/english.html) looks
great, but sadly once again a crap load of crazy dependencies:

* gtk >= 2.10
* cspi >= 1.0
* libgconf >= 2.0
* libglade >= 2.0
* libxml >= 2.0
* cairo
* librsvg
* (optional) libgnome >=2.0

Finally there is some talk of an Android virtual keyboard or Input method
framework (IMF) as Google call it on their
[roadmap](http://source.android.com/roadmap). I guess this will be implemented
as a [Dalvik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalvik_virtual_machine) and/or as a non-X application so I don't think this will be of any use
for Webconverger.

I think the best solution is to implement the keyboard as a [Firefox
addon](https://addons.mozilla.org) in Javascript. I swear there was such a
onscreen keyboard addon project in the past.  So like [[kiosk]] I might write
another Firefox addon to implement this feature sanely. Teemu also pointed me
out to [Javascript
VirtualKeyboard](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/scripting/jsvk.aspx) which may
prove handy.

Conclusion: Lets try accomplish stuff with Web technologies, not Gnome bloatware.
