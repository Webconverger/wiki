From [[6.0_to_6.1|changes/6.0-6.1]] we have the usual updated browser, flash and excitingly iso-hybrid support.

# Customising [iso-hybrid](http://git.debian-maintainers.org/?p=syslinux/syslinux.git;a=blob;f=doc/isolinux.txt#l80)

No need for separate [[img|usb]] and [[iso]] files. **One** ISO HYBRID file can
do **both**. You can burn the ISO and also image the same file to a USB stick.

The reason why [Webconverger has a commercial customisation
service](http://webconverger.com/buy) is that it used to be very difficult to
make trivial changes to the [[boot_command_line|boot]].
[[Thanks|acknowledgements]] to
[nils](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/msg/9379c3da15f08e6d) and to
[Daniel Baumann](http://blog.daniel-baumann.ch) especially for his hard work on this
[Debian Live](http://debian-live.alioth.debian.org/) feature, customisation has become
a lot easier for you.

The customisation steps are something like:

	mount -o loop webc-6.1.iso /mnt/webc/
	rsync -av /mnt/webc /mnt/custom
	chmod +w /mnt/custom/isolinux/live.cfg

Now edit `/mnt/custom/isolinux/live.cfg` and change the [[boot]] command line
with your homepage URL.

Now rebuild the ISO like so:

	mkisofs -o /tmp/custom-webc.iso -b -r -J -l -cache-inodes -allow-multidot -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table \
	-b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat /mnt/custom

Finally:

	/usr/bin/isohybrid /tmp/custom-webc.iso

`isohybrid` comes from a recent version of [syslinux](http://packages.debian.org/unstable/syslinux-common)

The [customisation service](http://webconverger.com/buy) remains if you are unable to perform these commands.
It's also difficult to edit the package listing, such as changing [[chrome|kiosk]]
without the [service](http://webconverger.com/buy) still. For
[[large_deployments|press]], please enquire with sales in how we can help you.

# Migrate your video content to open [HTML5 video](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#video) instead of [[Adobe_Flash|adobe]]

I agree with [Steve Jobs that Adobe has been lazy](http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/03/apple-shows-off/).

I am sick and tired of Flash killing the performance of Webconverger on
netbooks and its long running instabilities. Flash is really the only
proprietary non-free software in this opensource distribution.

So if you are a content creator, **please** move to HTML5 video.  I have
quickly made a [Web tool to help create HTML5 video](http://o.dabase.com/).

Webconverger's HTML5 video playback is far more stable and faster than Flash on
cheap netbooks. Yes, I'm aware [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/) is being a
little bit daft by UA sniffing.

Otherwise, do [download](http://download.webconverger.org/) and enjoy this new feature release of Webconverger and please [report
any issues to the mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users).
