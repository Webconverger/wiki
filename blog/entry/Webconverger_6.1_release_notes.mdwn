# Migrate your video content to open [HTML5 video](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#video) instead of [[Adobe_Flash|adobe]]

I agree with [Steve Jobs that Adobe has been lazy](http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/03/apple-shows-off/).

I am sick and tired of Flash killing the performance of Webconverger on
netbooks and its long running instabilities. Flash is really the only
proprietary non-free software in this opensource distribution.

So if you are a content creator, **please** move to HTML5 video.  I have
quickly made a [Web tool to help create HTML5 video](http://o.dabase.com/).

Webconverger's HTML5 video playback is far more stable and faster than Flash on
cheap netbooks. Yes, I'm aware [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/) is being a
little bit daft by UA sniffing.

Otherwise, do [download](http://download.webconverger.org/) and enjoy this new feature release of Webconverger and please [report
any issues to the mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users).
