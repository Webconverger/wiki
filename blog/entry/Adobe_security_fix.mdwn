The Webconverger 6.2 security release applies the [APSB10-14 security update
for the Adobe Flash
Player](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb10-14.html). This
fix for [numerous remote code execution bugs is only second to
Oracle](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=1&eotf=1&u=http://blog.fefe.de/%3Fts%3Db2ef379a&sl=de&tl=en)!

Once we've confirmed 6.2 in production I will remove the availability of the
older releases since this is such an important security fix.

Surprisingly this is the first update for almost 4 months. In it's current
(Debian Live **lenny**) design Webconverger has reached maturity as a piece of
software. Another reason to deploy it in a public space.
