With the help from an old friend [Hawken](http://dadako.com/), I am trying to come up with some sort of brand for Webconverger.

The final 'identity' is yet to be decided. However I thought I'll give you a taste of the previous rounds.

I'm trialling a serif (e.g. gentium/georgia) header font, with a sans (e.g. dejavusans, verdana) style text. Let me know what you think.
