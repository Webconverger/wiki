Happy new year 2009!

I'm staying at my parent's [Cornish cottage](http://prazefarm.co.uk/) and
enjoying slow Internet connectivity.

I moved the ADSL splitter to plug directly into the [BT
NTE5](http://www.telephonesuk.co.uk/images/NTE5_BT_front.jpg). I wish these
things had integrated [ADSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADSL) splitters and
basically [BT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_telecom) was responsible
for them.

I then emailed (wrong move) Devon based [Eclipse
Internet](http://www.eclipse.net.uk/) to retrain the connection, since the
connection seemed locked to half a meg... I should have called Eclipse support on
0845 1224 111 and actually got something done, instead of waiting for a week
for a silly email reply.

Another annoying element to Eclipse ISP is that they've dropped their unlimited
"Fair use" Evolution packages, ushering customers onto a limited bandwidth (3G
a month!) plans. Welcome to 2009 in the UK. Unbelievable. What's worse is that
seem to encourage you to prioritize traffic with their [traffic
controller](https://www.eclipse.net.uk/index.cfm?id=connectionmanager)... oh
pretty please [KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)!

I've reworked the home networking now too, which was a little tricky since the
[grade 2 listed house](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/tags/prazefarm/) has
**very** thick walls (especially on the ground level).

1. Master socket direct to upper level Linksys WAG354G Firmware Version: 1.01.11
* WAG354G to [wall power socket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_line_communication) [ZyXEL PLA401](http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/3106453789/)
* ZyXEL PLA401 to downstairs WRT54GL running the latest greatest [Tomato firmware](http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato)
* A second WRT54GL operating on [WDS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Distribution_System) extending both 'downstairs WRT54GL' and WAG354G wireless access point, towards the cottage

So the connection can hop from my X61 'wirelessly to' WRT54GL (WDS) 'wirelessly
to'  WRT54GL 'cabled to' PLA401 'powerlined to' PLA401 'cabled to' WAG354G
'ADSL to' Eclipse... Yowsers.

Retraining the ADSL connection according to BT can take several days. By that
time, I'll be back in the South East of England. I'm really hoping Praze Farm's
connection can increase from half a meg to something like the national UK
average of 2meg...
