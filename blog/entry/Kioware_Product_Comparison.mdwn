Webconverger versus [KioWare features](http://www.kioware.com/comparison.aspx):

* Browser - We use Firefox... Kioware seems to have recently switched to the Chrome browser from Internet Explorer
* [Blocking](http://www.kioware.com/lockdown-features.aspx) - Yes, we support all their features. See [[filtering]] for furthering information
* [Kiosk security](http://www.kioware.com/lockdown-features.aspx#Kiosk Security) - yes, we lock down everything. Strictly speaking we don't have a watchdog but we do have [[kiosk reset feature|blanking]] and [[cronjob]]
* [User management](http://www.kioware.com/lockdown-features.aspx#User Management) - yes, though we don't have a warning when [[an inactivity timer|blanking]] is about to elapse
* [User interface features](http://www.kioware.com/lockdown-features.aspx#User Interface Features) - yes, [[toolbar skins|kiosk]], though Virtual keyboard only on Android, on PC we can accomodate [[touch_screen_hardware|touch_screen_calibration]]
* [Kiosk Management](http://www.kioware.com/lockdown-features.aspx#Kiosk Management) - yes, configuration via <https://config.webconverger.com/>, though we do not allow local data to be stored (except config) and we do NOT track users.
* [External device support](http://www.kioware.com/lockdown-features.aspx#External Device Support) - largely **no**. Thought the Android version can read barcodes and work with a Chromecast
* [Reporting](http://www.kioware.com/lockdown-features.aspx#Reporting) - NO! We care about [[privacy]]. [We do not spy on our users!](/img/2015/kioware_privacy.png) Please gather statistics on your homepage.

Webconverger Web kiosk functionality compares closest to [Kioware
Basic](http://www.kioware.com/kwk_basic.aspx?c=kwkb_pricing) which charges
162USD for the license and 20% support annual cost on top of that. **[Webconverger pricing](https://webconverger.com/pricing/) includes support**.

**Excluding the price of Windows** which Kioware depends upon, we beat that
price as our annual fee is just 100USD. In the long term, consider three years
usage: With a **Webconverger 200USD one off subscription** we beat Kioware's
total cost proposition. 162USD + 3 * 0.20 * 162 = 259USD

Webconverger does have other
[[advantages|blog/entry/Comparing_to_our_competitors]] that their table doesn't
list. Webconverger does not need [antivirus
software](http://www.kioware.com/faqs.aspx?id=-1691678748) that Kioware
strongly recommends. And Webconverger doesn't need extra fiddling to lock down
the PC like [disabling USB memory
devices](http://www.kioware.com/faqs.aspx?id=1673344105&s=) as they suggest.

Webconverger is competitive when compared to Kioware's kiosk products.  That
aside Webconverger is easier and quicker to deploy, safe from viruses and has
better performance. [Download Webconverger](http://download.webconverger.com)
