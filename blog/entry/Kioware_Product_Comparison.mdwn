Kioware is a comparable competing product in the kiosk space with 5 products to
choose from.

Webconverger just has one kiosk product and let's check off [KioWare
features](http://www.kioware.com/comparison.aspx) we also do:

* Browser Lockdown - yes
* Popup Window Control - yes
* Domain/Page List Blocking - we simply rely on no URL address bar chrome=webcnoaddressbar for [[controlled_access|filtering]]
* Integrated Browser Error Handling - yes we can override the 404 IIUC
* Custom Navigational Toolbar Skins - no we don't do skins
* File Download Blocking - yes
* Remote XML Configuration - yes, we have a simpler line based API defined by [[boot]]
* Citrix/Terminal Server Support - no
* OS/Desktop Lockdown - yes
* Clear Cookies and Cache - yes
* Keyboard Filtering - yes
* Attract Screen Management - this can be done using a piece of [Javascript in your own Webpage](https://github.com/Webconverger/Screensaver/)
* Application Resetting - yes
* User Session Management - no we don't warn users they are taking too much time
* Virtual Keyboard - [an option atm](http://config.webconverger.com/faq/#does-webconverger-support-touch-screens)
* Automatically Run Logoff Script - this is like [[kioskresetstation|blanking]]
* Replace Windows Explorer Shell - yes though this is more of Windows specific thing
* Dialog Blocking - we do block popups by default, though I might have misunderstood this
* Hardware/Software Watchdog - we don't have this, but we do plan to develop something comparable
* Automatic Printer Retraction - no, I doubt this works in practice
* Security Mat/Proximity Switch - no we rely on folks closing the last tab, but though we can integrate this hardware if a customer chooses
* Barcode/MSR/Prox Reader Support - no
* Bill Acceptor/Card Dispenser Support - no
* Multiple Monitor Support (up to 10) - doable
* Phone Dialing through your Application - We can offer voice calling via the Google Talk plugin
* Upload Usage Stats - if you have Google analytics enabled on your site, we can arrange to identify the kiosk via a MAC id
* Remote Content Updating - yes, this is the same as the earlier "Remote XML Configuration" IIUC
* Server Side Kiosk Management - you can manage your kiosk in the cloud with Webconverger and achieve the same functionality
* Server Side Statistics Analysis - no, though it's trivial to use Google Analytics on your site to monitor your kiosk use
* Ad Hoc Grouping of kiosks - we identify machines by UUID and MAC ID and you are free to organise them as you wish
* Remote Monitoring - you simply monitor them by checking your logs if the kiosk if accessing your homepage. We do have a more proactive monitoring option, though that's only offered via [Neon](http://neon.webconverger.com/)
* Flexible User Accounts - no, though we do have "debug mode" for full access you can toggle on [[boot]]
* Store Custom Data on Individual Kiosks - we simply manage things in a flat file which a spreadsheet can be easily convert to
* API to Enable 3rd party add-ons - we can extend Webconverger with [Mozilla Addons](http://addons.mozilla.org), though this an extra you need to be quoted for
* Manage Multiple Client Sites - this isn't applicable, we manage everything in the cloud, in one place
* Host KioWare for Clients - We do offer methods of hosting your Webconverger kiosk network completely independently of us if that's your requirement

Webconverger compares closest to [Kioware Lite which is
priced](http://www.kioware.com/kwl.aspx?c=kwl_pricing) at 84USD a year IIUC.
Webconverger basic price is 120USD a year, 10USD per month. We plan to bring
back [[printing]] and perhaps the Google Talk plugin which will be closer to
their "Kioware Kiosk Basic" product at 162USD a year.

Webconverger does have other
[[advantages|blog/entry/Comparing_to_our_competitors]] that their table doesn't
mention.

In addition Webconverger does not need [antivirus
software](http://www.kioware.com/faqs.aspx?id=-1691678748) that Kioware
strongly recommends. And Webconverger doesn't need to extra lock down work like
[disabling USB memory
devices](http://www.kioware.com/faqs.aspx?id=1673344105&s=).

I hope this proves to you Webconverger is comparable and competitive opensource
kiosk product.
