Webconverger 8 allows you to deploy [Firefox
4.0.1](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/4.0.1/releasenotes/) in a kiosk
environment. This release uses a lot of upto date Debian packages from
[Progress Linux](http://progress-linux.org/).

Between [[7.2_to_8.0|changes/7.2-8.0]] there are several highlights such as:

* Firefox 4.0.1
* Updated adobe flash to 10.3.181.26
* 2.6.39 linux kernel
* A few extra locales, like South African English

This ISO's md5sum is 66456a5a4dc0dcbf5024f849f59a6dc3.

Security has been tightened up by removing
[terminals](http://git.webconverger.org/?p=webconverger-base;a=blob;f=debian/webconverger.init#l46),
though there are probably ways of downloading 32bit terminals for execution
that could be blocked.

There is a known issue where sometimes Webconverger boots without loading the
browser. This is a strange intermittent problem that needs debugging. If it
happens to you, please try booting again.

I personally will have problems fulfilling Webconverger customisation orders
between the 23rd of July and the beginning of October, due to the [Mongol
rally](http://www.theadventurists.com/the-adventures/mongol-rally) I'm
undertaking. Please consider [donating money to Mongolian
kids](http://www.justgiving.com/teams/geekout/) I'm raising for and wish team
[Geekout](http://geekout.org.uk) luck!

However if you email sales@webconverger.com, Daniel should be able to help you. :)
