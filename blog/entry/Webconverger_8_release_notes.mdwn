Webconverger 8 allows you to deploy [Firefox
4.0.1](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/4.0.1/releasenotes/) in a kiosk
environment. This release uses a lot of upto date Debian packages from
[Progress Linux](http://progress-linux.org/).

Between [[7.2_to_8.0|changes/7.2-8.0]] there are several highlights such as:

* Firefox 4.0.1
* Updated adobe flash to 10.3.181.26
* 2.6.39 linux kernel
* A few extra locales, like South African English

This ISO's md5sum is 66456a5a4dc0dcbf5024f849f59a6dc3. USA mirror: <http://download.webconverger.com/> Germany: <http://download.webconverger.org/>

Security has been tightened up by removing
[terminals](http://git.webconverger.org/?p=webconverger-base;a=blob;f=debian/webconverger.init#l46).
If you can figure out how to download a terminal and break out of the browser,
**please** email <security@webconverger.com>.

There is a two known issues that might affect you.

1) Very rarely Webconverger boots without loading the browser. I can't reproduce
it, so if you can, please tell me how you did it. The work around is sadly to
try booting again.

2) Sometimes Webconverger can time out loading
<http://portal.webconverger.com/>. I think this is due to the network not being
quite ready, or the homepage fetch has a short TTL. The workaround is to
refresh or use a homepage URL more local to you installation.

If you notice any more issues **please** report them to the [mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users).

I will personally have problems fulfilling Webconverger customisation orders
between the 23rd of July and the beginning of October, due to the [Mongol
rally](http://www.theadventurists.com/the-adventures/mongol-rally) I'm
undertaking. Please consider [donating money to Mongolian
kids](http://www.justgiving.com/teams/geekout/) I'm raising for and wish team
[Geekout](http://geekout.org.uk) luck!

However if you email <sales@webconverger.com>, Daniel should be able to help you. :)
