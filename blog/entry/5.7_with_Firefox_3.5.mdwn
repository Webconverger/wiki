5.7 features a lenny backported [Firefox 3.5](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/upgrade.html) build, finally!

Overall I would consider this release as **experimental**.

There is a couple new known bugs introduced with Firefox 3.5. Namely you can
now non-persistently change configuration settings in the about: URL and browse
the local filesystem.

This introduces possibly some security issues and of course I would rather have
the kiosk more locked down that this current state. Sadly Firefox is very
difficult to modify into a sane kiosk deployment. I've written a kiosk
extension myself and trying to implement `NsIContentPolicy` to control these
local URLs and file downloads is proving to be beyond my ability.

If you're a developer familiar with Firefox, please take a look at my notes on
the [[kiosk]] wiki page.

# Debian installer is disabled and I won't re-enable it

Yes, I've disabled the debian installer again. It's far too complicated and I
am going to write my own installer.

If you are tech-savvy you can simply install Webconverger by:

	wget http://download.webconverger.org/webc-5.7.img
	sudo dd if=webc-5.7.img of=/dev/sda

This will **replace** the contents of your first hard drive (typically) with Webconverger.

What I do in my deployments is use a "debug version" of Webconverger to perform these installs.

# 5.7 release notes

I've enabled FF3.5's [Private
Browsing](http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Private+Browsing) feature by
default. Strictly speaking since the `~/.mozilla` directory is purged between
sessions, making this feature is totally unneccessary and probably introduces
problems. However I'm thinking "security in layers" and "lets give it go".

Spelling does not seem to work. Something is wrong with the myspell
dictionaries and FF3.5 backport. I need to fix this. On the plus side, you
might it quicker not to have spelling support. :)

If you notice a [SPLASHY
ERROR](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/4085980139/) on bootup, do not be
alarmed, this is normal. I am looking to replace the horrible software used to
simply not have linux print copious lines out to the screen, with another crazy
like the 28k SLOC [Project
Plymouth](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Plymouth). Ok, maybe not. :)
If only linux `quiet` worked.
