Hello everyone! 5.5 is a much delayed release which is not as polished as I
would have liked. Instead of delaying any further, I would appreciate you
giving these experimental features a try and giving feedback on them.

* [Allow ICMP ping replies](http://git.debian.org/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=blob;f=webconverger/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/iptables.conf) so that you can check the machine is up and running.
* Allow for several homepages to be specified which get opened in separate tabs, e.g. `homepage=http://portal.webconverger.com/%20http://webconverger.com`
* [noclutter](http://packages.qa.debian.org/u/unclutter.html) added, which hides the mouse cursor after a couple of seconds of inactivity
* Several new [experimental hooks](http://git.debian.org/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=tree;f=webconverger/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/network/if-up.d) to [[upgrade|boot]] and setup [[CJK_locales|i18n]]
* A new PDF viewer based on [epdfview](http://packages.qa.debian.org/e/epdfview.html), which unlike `xpdf` has a decent [[printing]] dialog!
* Anything else? See `vimdiff http://download.webconverger.com/webc-5.2.txt http://download.webconverger.com/webc-5.5.txt`

# Experimental option to [[install_Webconverger_onto_a_hard_drive|installer]]

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/3915352042/" title="awful grub-pc dialog by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2478/3915352042_336d04f2c8.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="awful grub-pc dialog" /></a>

The included EXPERIMENTAL [[installer]] has problems. For example the [[USB]]
version only seems to work when installing without a network due to some odd
grub2 transition. The development cycles for debugging [[installer]] related
issues is incredibly long and painful. The whole effort might have been a
colossal waste of time, considering USB boots are **just as fast** as
booting from a hard disk.

If you would like to see this feature stay, please [[test|testing]], report
bugs and [[develop]] patches.

The next release will focus on packaging Firefox 3.5 and the [[kiosk]] extension for it.
