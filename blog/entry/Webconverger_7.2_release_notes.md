# Webconverger 7.2

7.2 is a minor **security** update which fixes
[two](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/webc-users/DAcUOUDqc2U/discussion)
[issues](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/webc-users/KTl1fbklDcs/discussion)
raised by François Audirac. Many [[thanks|acknowledgements]] François.

7.2 should also fix a problem with [Intel GMA 3150
cards](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/webc-users/PFbCRp2SI2o/discussion)
confirmed by Alex Garza.

Other changes are itemised in [[7.1_to_7.2_changes|changes/7.1-7.2]] and the
md5sum is `1986001c342066cfe1c6ec8db3c8206f`.

I've quickly analysed the [[ping logs|privacy]] and it looks like ~75% has made
the upgrade from 7.0 to 7.1, which is better than I expected. Unfortunately the
user base of Webconverger seems roughly _stable_ month by month at around
~1200.

My time on Webconverger is limited due to several other parallel projects I'm
involved in, so if you can [help out](http://webconverger.com/work/), get in
touch. Be good if someone could [fix the default language for
spelling](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/5400400653/). :)
