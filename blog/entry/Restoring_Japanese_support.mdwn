Years ago [CJK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK) was simply supported by the
appropriate [SCIM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Common_Input_Method)
based packages in Linux distributions.

For **old** versions of Webconverger, one needed to simply add the packages:

	ttf-vlgothic scim-anthy scim-uim scim-skk scim-prime scim-canna scim-tables-ja

And it worked amazingly, considering SCIM was written in a billion lines of
bonkers C++. Unsurprisingly it became unmaintained.

Now we have [ibus](http://code.google.com/p/ibus/) with replaces the
functionaliy of the unmaintained SCIM porject and allows input method switching
in Xorg.

However [Japanese users I'm told do not like basic
ibus](http://twitter.com/nikkei_linux/status/228138085928534016) and want
[mozc](http://code.google.com/p/mozc/) too.

So after serveral hours of
[moaning](http://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/238609063565475840) in in the new
Webconverger the [[development|develop]] process requires to tweak the existing
chroot. We need to add the following packages

	ibus-mozc mozc-utils-gui ttf-vlgothic ibus-gtk

Building these and their dependencies would take a LOT of time, so I am
thankful Webconverger is still based upon [Debian
packaging](http://packages.qa.debian.org/m/mozc.html) .

To get the ibus daemon running you need to add into `~/.xinitrc`:

	export GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus
	export XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus
	export QT_IM_MODULE=ibus
	ibus-daemon -x -d

And you need to `ibus-setup` in advance with by extracting in the ~webc:

	curl -s http://archive.webconverger.com/japanese-mozc-gconf.tar.gz  |  tar zxvf -

Finally outside the chroot, you need to append `locale=ja` on the
`--bootappend-live` line of `auto/config`.

Here is my [complete work log](http://archive.webconverger.com/ja-build.log) to
guide you through the currently cumbersome process.

1. The packages
2. ibus environment details for .xinitrc
3. bonkers gconf configuration preload
4. locale=ja on the boot parameter

Hopefully in the future with Japanese developer support, we can have Japanese
support by default in Webconverger. If you don't manage to build it, [try
