As I mentioned on the previous blog titled [[Roadmap]], [Brendan Sleight is helping out the
project by running a Webconverger ISO through qemu and recording it to a
video.](http://autotesting.livecd.org/webconverger/)
Awesome eh?

Now I need to figure out how to link deeper into a video, after a certain
amount of seconds just before X starts,
[splashy](http://splashy.alioth.debian.org/wiki/) prematurely quits. That's a
bug.

I've also come across the astonishing [Simple Light Incredible Temporary
Autonomus Zone](http://www.slitaz.org/en) project. A rival Live distro that
weighs in at just **25M**. Webconverger is 10x the size and provides
embarrassingly less functionality. I've signed up to their mailing list and I
am investigating their miracle [[diet_for_Webconverger|Live_and_Lean]].
