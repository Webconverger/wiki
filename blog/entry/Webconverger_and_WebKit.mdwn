Thanks to [Mike Hommey](http://glandium.org/)'s [webkit
packages](http://packages.qa.debian.org/w/webkit.html), [Alp
Toker](http://www.atoker.com/blog/)'s Gtk/Webkit
[changeset](http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/32766) of Rodney Dawes Flash
support and countless others we have serious competition for Firefox.

I've added a [webkit
directory](http://git.debian.org/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=tree;f=webkit)
for [[developing|develop]] Webconverger with WebKit. There are two ways to play
with WebKit. A basic library wrapper called:

	/usr/lib/webkit-1.0/libexec/GtkLauncher

from libwebkit-1.0-1. And the [Debian epiphany-webkit](http://packages.qa.debian.org/e/epiphany-browser.html) actually uses that library to provide the [Epiphany Web browser](http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/).

Epiphany is a little annoying as it seems to bring in a lot of Gnome [cruft](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2607825083/). Also I hate [dbus](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2607825079/) dependencies. Still need to get [[Webconverger_on_a_diet|Live_and_Lean]]!

[[PDF|adobe]] viewing does not work atm and Epiphany also needs its seriously chrome hacked to disable bookmarking amongst many other elements, to make it [[kiosk_grade|kiosk]]. Anyway, the simple `GtkLauncher` is almost OK really. So have a look at webc-webkit-r33561.* in the [[mini]] [download directory](http://download.webconverger.com/mini).

Put a hard hat on and feel free to peruse my "work-in-progress" [webconverger webkit screenshots](http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=16105436%40N00&q=webconverger+webkit&m=tags).
