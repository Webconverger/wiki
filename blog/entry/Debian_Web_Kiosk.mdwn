So you're a super smart Debian/Ubuntu geek. :)

Here's a chance to **impress** when you have friends over. Hopefully your friends
like computers too via the familiar Firefox Web browser.

To save some blushes when your 'personal' Web history might be exposed whilst showing your friends some cool new Web application...

Use **Webconverger**!

Add:

	deb http://debian.webconverger.com/ lenny/

To your '/etc/apt/sources.list'

	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install webconverger-base iceweasel-webconverger

You should then be prompted to install two packages:

	iceweasel-webconverger - the firefox extension to lock down the browser
	webconverger-base - the bits that create a private browser using webc

<img style="float: right;" src="http://webconverger.com/logos/flower100.png" />

Install them. Now the geeky part:

1. [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[F6] and login into tty6 with your usual username.
* `sudo su - webc`
* `startx -- :1`

Here we launch a seperate X session in the webc's user **sandboxed** space.

* [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[F7] should get you back to your normal X :0
* [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[F8] switches you to your second webc X :1

To quit and clean up, on your second X :1 [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[Backspace] and logout from the webc user and finally:

	sudo apt-get remove webconverger-base iceweasel-webconverger

`iceweasel-webconverger` atm will lock down any user's browser on your system. So you might want to uninstall it once you're done.

Webconverger aims to uphold your [[privacy]] with this [Internet Appliance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_appliance) aka Web Kiosk standalone mode for your Debian/Ubuntu system. This is an initial release, so my clever brethren, if you spot any [[security]] bugs in [webconverger-base](http://git.webconverger.org/?p=webconverger-base.git), do tell.

P.S. If you have no friends this Webconverger mode is good for porn. ;)
