5.6 is a bugfix release.

`vimdiff http://download.webconverger.org/webc-5.5.txt
http://download.webconverger.org/webc-5.6.txt` reveals the usual browser
updates.

The change to [webconverger-base fixes the home button when more than one URL is specified](http://git.webconverger.org/?p=webconverger-base.git;a=commit;h=00af4186fe28b21df7787666609495862cacb61a) on the [[boot_command_line|boot]].

Lately I have been working on **static** Firefox builds, as I hope they may
help make [[upgrading|upgrade]] manageable.
