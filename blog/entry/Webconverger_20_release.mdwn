# Upgrading bandwidth

<img src="/img/upgrade-bandwidth19-20.png" width=960 height=720 alt="112MB upgrade">

If you are using the recommended <a
href="http://config.webconverger.com/faq/#what-do-you-mean-by-live-version-and-install-version">Install
version of Webconverger</a>, you should seamlessly upgrade incrementally day by
day as [Webconverger is
updated](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commits/master). In other words,
Webconverger is maintenance free.

I've measured the upgrade size as about 112M from a fresh 19.1 install. My
methodology was to to install the previous [[Webconverger_19_release]]. Then
reboot with [[debug]] mode enabled and `grep upgrade /var/log/syslog` from time
to time until it was finished downloading from our [origin hosted at
Github](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc).

To see how much data was transferred, `cat /proc/net/netstat` and plug in the
large value into Google.com and append "bytes into megabytes".
