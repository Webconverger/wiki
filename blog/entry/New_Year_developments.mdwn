For want of a better place, I thought it would be prude to outline our ".COM"
business activities on the ".ORG" blog.

Please let me welcome [Mike Kaply](http://mike.kaply.com/) in Austin Texas to
our sales list. Since Patrick and I are based in Singapore, we have honestly
found supporting US customers difficult due to the time differences. Mike has
been helping out with the [Webconverger Firefox
addon](https://github.com/Webconverger/iceweasel-webconverger) and an amazing
outside contributor to the [Mozilla Enterprise
list](https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/enterprise). Mike has helped a LOT of
businesses roll out Firefox to their users and by being a part of Webconverger,
I hope he help people even further.

Ultimately our business activities make this body of free software better and
help spread it. We do offer educational / non-profit discounts and recently we
are working with [Techsoup](http://www.techsoup.org/) to help spread
Webconverger for use in libraries. We are still [under
trial](https://twitter.com/TechSoup4Libs/status/281512991550230529) though we
hope to ramp up our efforts in February.

Previously our "business communication" was done by our newsletter which you
can subscribe on <http://webconverger.com/>. You can think of the newsletter as
an abbreviated edition of this blog in your inbox. So you don't have to employ
a RSS feedreader, hawkishly watch our [Twitter
stream](https://twitter.com/webconverger) or visit this page all the time.
We've written our [own newsletter
software](https://github.com/kaihendry/sg-hackandtell/tree/master/list) to
basically turn these blogs into email newsletters for your convenience.

So what's happening? We are upgrading the base of Webconverger to
[wheezy/baureo-backports](https://gist.github.com/4442085) based on work by
[Progress Linux](http://progress-linux.org/). This should help us better
support newer video hardware. We are also working on migrating our boot process
to [systemd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd). This hopefully should
simplify our init process and make it faster. We also expect to running with a
newer kernel shortly. Hopefully within a week from now we will be open for
testing.

The objective is to support the Intel NUC **perfectly**. Including Linux/Web
[hardware acceleration](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=828799).

In parallel we are working on some Web signage demos and contributing to the
[W3C Web signage](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-websignage/)
forum, advocating Web technologies. We have had several meetings with Media
Owners, who are very keen to move to a networked signage solution though there
are a few things stopping them. For example:

In Singapore it can cost as much as 100SGD a month to keep a single device
connected to an Internet connection per month. That's roughly 3 times as much
as we charge for our software.

There is a lot of embedded Android devices being advertised for signage use
case. For basic things though do a good job on the face of it. However the
Android solutions are **not Web based** and the typical Android hardware is
**not yet powerful enough to drive a large Web rendering**. Explaining this
subtle differences is surprisingly difficult.

In other news you might be thinking, where is [Firefox
18.0](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/18.0/releasenotes/)? It has a bug
that makes the [langpacks fail to
load](https://twitter.com/webconverger/status/289276669267673089) and we are
waiting for Mozilla to fix this.

Many of our customers have asked for a "one off" payment, since they don't find
the subscriptions attractive. We are about to introduce a new price offering of
double the annual fee, 200USD, which will give said PC unlimited upgrades for
as long as this project survives. I hope you find that interesting. We will be
implementing it in the near future via Paypal.
