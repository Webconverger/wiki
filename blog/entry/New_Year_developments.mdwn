For want of a better place, I thought it would be prude to outline our ".COM"
business activities on the ".ORG" blog.

Please let me welcome [Mike Kaply](http://mike.kaply.com) in Austin, Texas to
our sales list. Since Patrick and I are based in Singapore(+8 UTC), we have honestly
found supporting US (~-6 UTC) customers difficult due to the time differences. Mike has
been helping out with the [Webconverger Firefox
addon](https://github.com/Webconverger/iceweasel-webconverger) and an amazing
outside contributor to the [Mozilla Enterprise
list](https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/enterprise). Mike has advised a LOT of
businesses on how to customize and roll out Firefox to their users and by being
a part of Webconverger, I hope he helps people even further.

Ultimately our business activities make this body of free software better and
help spread it. We do offer educational / non-profit discounts and recently we
are working with [Techsoup](http://www.techsoup.org/) to help spread
Webconverger for use in libraries. We are still [under
trial](https://twitter.com/TechSoup4Libs/status/281512991550230529) though we
hope to ramp up our distribution in February.

Previously our "business communication" was solely done by our email newsletter
(with no Web archive) subscribed upon at
<http://webconverger.com/>. You can now think of the newsletter as an abbreviated
edition of this blog in your inbox. So you don't have to employ a RSS
feedreader, hawkishly watch our [Twitter
stream](https://twitter.com/webconverger) or visit this page all the time.
We've written our [own newsletter
software](https://github.com/kaihendry/sg-hackandtell/tree/master/list) to
basically turn these blogs into email newsletters for your convenience.

So what's happening technically? We are upgrading the base of Webconverger to
[wheezy/baureo-backports](https://gist.github.com/4442085) based on work by
[Progress Linux](http://progress-linux.org/). This should help us better
support newer video hardware. We are also working on migrating our boot process
to [systemd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd). This should simplify our
init process and make it faster. We also expect to employ a newer kernel
shortly. Hopefully within a week from now we will be open for testing.

Our objective is to support the [[Intel NUC|Next_Unit_of_Computing]]
**perfectly**. Including Linux/Web [hardware
acceleration](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=828799).

In parallel we are working on some Web signage demos and contributing to the
[W3C Web signage](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-websignage/)
forum, advocating Web technologies. We have had several meetings with Media
Owners, who are very keen to move to a networked signage solution though there
are a few things stopping them. For example:

In Singapore it can cost as much as 100SGD a month to keep a single device
connected to an Internet connection. That's roughly 3 times as much as we
charge for our more expensive [Neon Web signage
software](http://neon.webconverger.com/), since it has monitoring.

There is a lot of embedded Android devices being advertised for signage use
case. For basic things they do a good job on the face of it. However the
Android solutions are **not Web based** and the typical Android hardware is
**not yet powerful enough to drive a large Web rendering**. Explaining this
subtle differences to "Media Owners" is surprisingly difficult. Our approach
for the short term is to encourage Media Owners to become familiar with small
Web signage deployments using our Neon software and Intel NUC PC hardware,
which is a much more affordable option than a year ago.

In other news you might be thinking, where is the faster [Firefox
18.0](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/18.0/releasenotes/)? It has a bug
that makes the [langpacks fail to
load](https://twitter.com/webconverger/status/289276669267673089) and we are
waiting for Mozilla to fix this.

Many of our customers have asked for a "one off" payment, since they don't find
the ongoing subscriptions attractive, which can be an administrative burden. We
are about to introduce a new "one off subscription" price offering of double
the annual fee, 200USD, which will give said PC unlimited upgrades for as long
as this project survives. We hope you find that an appealing way to support our
work. We will be implementing this payment option in the near future via Paypal
and quoting accordingly.
