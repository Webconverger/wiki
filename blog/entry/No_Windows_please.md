I'm venting my opinion about (mobile) user interfaces in light of [Aza Raskin's concept post](http://azarask.in/blog/post/firefox-mobile-concept-video/).

For me there are (broadly speaking) **two categories** of computing [user interfaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interfaces):

1. Non-overlapping [tiles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager)
* Overlapping (floating) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_(computing)">windows</a> aka the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)">WIMP</a> paradigm

[Microsoft Windows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) (post 1.0) made err...
the floating (overlapping) **windows** style interface familiar to millions of people, though I think
there are problems with floating **windows**:

* Different sized windows aren't useful, esp. very small ones.
* Dragging items between windows usage paradigm is not that common ([copy&paste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut%2C_copy%2C_and_paste) is easier)
* Managing different windows is hard, esp. when they **overlap**. Clutter!
* **Popup windows suck**
* Hidden / obscured / dragged off screen windows suck

So if I am right, why aren't we seeing **tiled** user interfaces?

Well I believe most people nowadays know _tiled user interfaces_ simply as
[tabs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabbed_document_interface). And we
hopefully agree that browsers have made the tabs UI paradigm pretty mainstream.

Safari on the Iphone is also basically a _tabbed user interface_ too and I like
it. Apple's fixed maximised tab is right for browsing on mobile devices.

In my experience 'designers' don't really understand scalable / resizable user
interfaces.  Traditional designers know
[A4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size) and exploit such print dimensions
to showcase their work.  So again forcing designers to think at fixed intervals
of screen sizes like 480Ã—320 in the case of the Iphone works. (resizable or
overlapping) windows doesn't.

If you're a Linux user (Ubuntu maybe?) and you want to try the tiled UI
paradigm for more than just your browser (Firefox), give the excellent
[dwm](http://www.suckless.org/wiki/dwm/about) window manager a try. It's
what Webconverger uses. :)

Update: The [image above](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2053830046/)
could be a little misleading, as [Windows
mobile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_mobile) does not actually use
floating (overlapping) windows on their platform.  Proof that Mozilla should
really steer clear of this path in it's UI design for mobile environs!

Those people who make those [Webtops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_desktop) like this [one](http://mochaui.com/demo/) are impressive. Though I still think the overlapping windows in a browser window is broken and stupid.
