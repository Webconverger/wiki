Some of you may have noticed the [Webconverger
portal](http://portal.webconverger.com/) has been not working as it should.
Apologies.

[Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com/) where the portal is hosted has upgraded to
PHP5 and since the site makes use of the
[Apache AddLanguage feature](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_mime.html#addlanguage)
their *.php directive wasn't catching the files. The solution was to add to the
`.htaccess`:

	<Files *.php.*>
	ForceType php5-cgi
	</Files>

So the portal currently has translations in:

	humantorch:462$ ls *.php*
	index.php.cn  index.php.en  index.php.fi  index.php.nl
	index.php.de  index.php.es  index.php.fr  index.php.sv

If you want to create a portal for your country, I'm very receptive to adding
it. If you find the links on any of the version of the portal could be better,
please let us know too.

Thank you [sneekylinux](http://www.youtube.com/user/sneekylinux) for the above
succinct video. Also recently Webconverger has been featured in the German
[[press]].

With all this talk of "Cloud Computing", Webconverger really should be
receiving some more press, as Webconverger makes the perfect **cloud client**.
