Webconverger 15 realises a [[design]] goal to seamlessly [[upgrade]]. A feature
that no other Linux distribution has.

Currently [[upgrades|upgrade]] only works on the writable [install
version](http://config.webconverger.com/faq/#what-do-you-mean-by-live-version-and-install-version-?),
not the **Live** / read-only version that you will try at first.

You might be wondering what the hell does **486:** and **686-pae:** mean. You
should be safe with the default **686-pae: Live** kernel choice, though if it
doesn't work on ancient hardware, that is what the 486 kernel is for. In the
future we will endeavour to _reduce_ these options and make the kernel choice
automatic.

What else has changed?

* [Firefox 15.0.1](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/15.0/releasenotes/)
* `xinput=` [[touch screen calibration]] [[API]]
* `log=` [[debug]] [[API]]
* Restored 486 support for old PC hardware
* `chrome=debug` for browser debugging & testing
* Fix PDF support which was accidentally broken in 14.1
* Restore [[printing]] support with CUPS
* Did I mention Webconverger is the first git upgradable Linux distro?

Full log can be found with the command: `git log --oneline --decorate
14.1..15.0` from the [chroot](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc).
