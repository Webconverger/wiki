## Google could not have started in the UK

In order to be a successful 'dot COM' business a good Internet connection is a
basic requirement. No, you can't "work from anywhere". You must have a fast &
reliable Internet connection.

Most Web developers in the UK host their applications in the USA where the
costs are much lower. Any company I've heard that co-locates or rents space in
the UK is paying about a two fold premium to do so. However it's about [20%
cheaper in Germany](http://wiki.webvm.net/hardware/hosting/) compared to the
UK, with 3x increased latencies.

Now if you are an innovative IT company you really need your machines and
services close by for fast development iterations.

**Google could never have started in the UK.** How on earth would they have had
the right IT environment to grow when bandwidth is so incredibly expensive in
the UK?  [JANET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JANET) don't have a clear policy
WRT commercial "research" connectivity services. From past experience of JANET
network administrators if you wanted them to host an enterprise like Google
they would have responded with their typical "can't do" attitude.

google.ja.net? You're dreaming.

## Bamboozled

Typically a demanding UK business could be connected by LAN Extension aka
'leased line' aka LES100 (mbit) or WES (wholesale). This high end Internet
market in the UK is full of meaningless service level agreements, mis-leading
acronyms and terminology. The sales people will ease you into a false sense of
confusion. Bonded, expresstream, dedicated, scalable 2M-10M and other sort of
bollocks. Dedicated "tail circuits" to their [point of presences
(PoP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_presence) typically start at
2500GBP for installation and similar upkeep costs per month.

If you ask a reasonable question like: "Will my upload channel be faster than
the 100 kB/sec I currently get from my [Virgin
XL](http://webconverger.org/blog/entry/UK_Internet/) connection?", the sales
people won't know. They'll sprout bullshit about how their contention is better
or that they can handle more parallel connections. Actually I just want to
serve (upload) as fast as possible. 100 kB/sec (1M) upload is too slow. Good
domestic broadband can currently suck down at 1000kB/sec (10M) to give you some
perspective.

Most business UK leased lines barely compete with cabled domestic connections.
Especially since high quality broadband ADSL connections are no more than 30GBP
a month. Ideally there should be no distiction between domestic and business
connections, though the UK sales boys don't miss a trick.

If your company is based in London, perhaps you can actually connect straight
up to fibre to an exchange like [LONAP](http://www.lonap.net/). This typically
will cost your premises at **least** 20kGBP to get hooked up. Plus all sorts of
equipment rental and bandwidth costs. If I was budgeting, I would say 50k GBP
was needed just to get started. Combined with your London rental rates, why not
pile your venture capital in a mound and just set fire to it?

## Non-Wired West

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2756836140/" title="Globalcrossing UK fibre optic map by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3169/2756836140_566a6ceafa.jpg" width="500" height="353" alt="Globalcrossing UK fibre optic map" /></a>

The irony is in [Cornwall, Praze Farm](http://prazefarm.co.uk/), my family home
is adjacent to fibre optic cable running along the A30 motorway. Probably the [fastest
Internet connections in the world are the transatlantic links between Cornwall
and New York](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC-2). However neither [Global
Crossing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Crossing) or
[EasyNet](http://www.easynet.com), would consider a splice into either of their
cables that run along the A30.

If you believed the "connected" hype from government and schemes derived from
[Objective One](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_One) such as:

* [Actnow Cornwall](http://www.actnowcornwall.co.uk)
* [Wired West](http://www.wiredwest.co.uk/site/1/CORNWALL_HUB.html)
* [Beacon technology park](http://www.objectiveone.com/client/media/media-522.htm)

You could be fooled into thinking that EU money was going into improving the IT
infrastructure in the South West of England. The truth is very different.

There are no "point of presence" (PoP) hubs in Cornwall as far as I'm aware, so
you can **not** get a costly high end leased line even if you wanted to. In the
Cornish countryside a typical broadband connection is about 1M down and 0.5M
up. So a symmetrical leased line to 2M~10M would be a massive improvement, at
great expense. Anyway there is no such (WES) option offered by British Telecom
(BT) in Cornwall.

The fastest connections in Cornwall are probably at Penwith College (Penzance),
University College Falmouth & Truro College, all connected by the
[JANET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JANET) offshoot
[SWERN](http://www.swern.net.uk/). However they have no links near me in
Bodmin, I've checked.

## The highways agency

Webconverger isn't the only company that could do with a fast Internet
connection.  After calling
[EnterpriseMoucel](http://www.enterprisemouchel.com/) who manage the A30 from
Exeter to Penzance, they were interested too about getting connected to fibre. They need fast Internet for their cameras to stream data to their control centre. Currently they use an obscenely expensive microwave link between [Mount and Looe](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&saddr=mount,+cornwall&daddr=looe,+cornwall&hl=en&geocode=&mra=ls&dirflg=w&sll=50.415675,-4.535715&sspn=0.211331,0.440826&ie=UTF8&ll=50.424706,-4.534607&spn=0.21129,0.440826&t=h&z=11) supplied by [BT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Telecom).

## Compared to copper

Imagine your business could only have **one** telephone line. That's what *good
domestic broadband* or 'entry level' leased line gives your business. The
ability to serve just one customer at a time. Your business would not be able
to grow.  This is the poisonous state of the current IT infrastructure in
Britain.

Aside from the frustrating [UK business banking
service](http://natalian.org/archives/2008/08/06/british-banking/) to deal
with, I can't help but think if a serious IT firm wanted to innovate it would
have to be based elsewhere. Trouble is, there aren't many fertile grounds in the
world. I can only think of:

* USA, especially [Silicon Valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_valley)
* Japan
* Korea
* Bangalore, India

It's a shame Britain can't seem to get its act together with respect to wired
fibre optic Internet links when we are such a small country. Attitudes must
change. Fibre optics must come above ground. Britain must become better wired
for new IT based economies to grow. Government should make this a national
issue and nationalise the fibre optic network.
