So [Google announced support for the Web platform on netbooks](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html)!

Webconverger has enjoyed quite good support for netbooks already at least from the
[[4.9_release|blog/entry/4.9_release_notes]].

I've updated the [Webconverger comparison
matrix](http://webconverger.com/about/) with some assumptions about [Google
Chrome OS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome_OS) (GCOS).

The big problem I predict with Google Chrome OS (GCOS) is that it will not be
able to run on a variety of PCs. Hence you will have to buy specific new
hardware for GCOS. What about all those old PCs out there? Ignoring them isn't
very environmentally friendly Google. Webconverger runs on old recycled
hardware and hence exhibits very low [[requirements]].

(Nonetheless, I'm really hoping GCOS will get rid of the bane of my life, that
is [X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorg).)

Hence GCOS will be a probably be a pain for deployment since it will likely need to be
ported to each new video card.

I've also assumed Google will require you to have a Google account like it
already does with Android. The Web is an open platform and you shouldn't _have
to_ use Google services.

Will GCOS have a PDF viewer? I'll assume not since Android doesn't have one.

Will Google support GCOS, service it and sell it, like [Webconverger
does](http://webconverger.com/buy/)?

Will GCOS be versatile enough to work as [[digital_signage|kiosk]]? Google has
some catching up to do. See you next decade then. :)
