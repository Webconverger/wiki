# Known issues

* Spelling language has to be manually chosen and doesn't respect chosen locale [[boot]] options
* The **debian installer** which only worked on the [[ISO]] version is **temporarily disabled** until the debian installer uses 2.6.29 which supports [squashfs 4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squashfs).
* USB version seems to trigger _Unknown video mode_ at least on our test systems
* [CJK support disabled](http://lists.debian.org/debian-live/2009/04/msg00151.html) until new code proven and accepted in [live-initscripts](http://git.debian.net/?p=debian-live/live-initscripts.git)
