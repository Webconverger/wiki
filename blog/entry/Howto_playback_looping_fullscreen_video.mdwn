Say you want to use Webconverger for **Web digital signage**, to playback an
HTML video in fullscreen in a loop. Such a configuration would look like:

	homepage=http://signage.webconverger.com
	prefs=http://ppd.webconverger.com/2013/attract.js
	hidecursor
	noblank
	chrome=neon

As for view-source:http://signage.webconverger.com/ it's a very simple use of
[HTML
video](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-video-element.html#the-video-element):

	<video id=signage autoplay loop src=demo.webm></video>
	<script>
	video = document.getElementById('signage');
	video.mozRequestFullScreen();
	</script>

The only complication is that we only currently support WebM format for
playback. MP4 licensing lately is easing up and we [plan to support MP4
playback](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/issues/161). Do ask if you need
help [converting your video to
WebM](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/issues/161), from MP4 or from a
bunch of images.

You can also re-purpose this technique as a [Screensaver / Attraction loop for
Webconverger](https://github.com/Webconverger/Screensaver/).

"Is this Webconverger Neon?" you may ask. Yes. Neon has converged into
Webconverger in every functionality, except the [heavyweight ssh based
monitoring](http://webconverger.org/blog/entry/Monitoring_kiosk_uptime/) and
the price.
