Just for fun I compared [Ubuntu 8.04 Beta](http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/hardy/beta) to [[Webconverger_3]] (beta).

I'm not sure if Ubuntu boots faster than Webconverger, but it certainly a lot
slicker then the current text based boot of Webconverger.

Ok, that bloated Gnome desktop loaded quicker than expected. I wondered what was behind that Mail icon.

Evolution... which I couldn't further trial as I couldn't figure out how to scale the window for the little screen I was testing Ubuntu on. :/

Next I was amazed Ubuntu shipped Firefox 3b5. Earlier I was thinking I was being a bit risky with [[Webconverger_3]]!

I tried a couple of typical use cases in the browser environment.

1. Opening a PDF
* Watching a YouTube video

Opening a PDF pops up an external window. In Webconverger [PDFs open inline the same browser window](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/851173358/), which I think is much more usable.

Next getting Youtube working was a 10 minute mission.

1. [Choose your flash plugin](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2443396689/in/set-72157604743185232/)
* [I chose the first option and waited for stuff to install](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2443396681/in/set-72157604743185232/)
* [Er... I need a codec](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2444231600/in/set-72157604743185232/)
* [And install the codec](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2443396691/in/set-72157604743185232/)
* [Do some waiting](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2444231598/in/set-72157604743185232/)

And finally after being very patient (or drunk) I managed to get a Youtube
video to playback. Flash "just works" in Webconverger as the [non-free
flash plugin](http://packages.qa.debian.org/f/flashplugin-nonfree.html) is preloaded.

I did then try watch an OGG video from Ubuntu's Firefox and it did manage to
playback, which was impressive. However it was not [inline
HTML](http://webkit.org/blog/140/html5-media-support/) of course.  I was unable
to seek through the video and then I tried to watch the video again and it
didn't seem to work at all. Sad. :/

Anyway, I really think Ubuntu should endeavour to improve the user experience
**via** the Web. The Web is the free software platform. Not these horrible
Gnome/KDE "Windows" throwbacks. :)
