As [Linux Torvalds
says](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=MShbP3OpASA#t=1492s),
"Linux on the Desktop", aka Linux on PCs is hard to crack since machines are
not pre-installed with it.

We at Webconverger would love to see our software pre-installed on machines
designed for public kiosk applications.

It's hard enough for folks to simply ready a USB stick with Webconverger.
Despite [third parties who offer USB keys with
Webconverger](http://www.osdisc.com/cgi-bin/view.cgi/products/linux/webconverger)
and our great [tutorial videos](http://www.youtube.com/webconverger/)
to guide you.

The PC vendors need to wake up and innovate. PC hardware innovation compared to
Apple has been disbolically bad in the last 10 years. See the demise of the
Lenovo Thinkpad as a prime example. Microsoft's monopoly is threatening to
further tighten under the [guise of Trusted
Compting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing).

I predict PCs will see their market share further wiped out by ARM and embedded
Android devices that can basically fufill use cases, historically done by PCs.
With ARM, they certainly cannot compete on price, so we need to see innovation.
Give customers better solutions. Embed Webconverger for public access computing
and give your customers less headaches!
