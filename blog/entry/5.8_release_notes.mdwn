Festive greetings!

Apologies for being quiet lately despite big news that [Chromium
OS](http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os) sources has been released. Sometime
ago I [predicted and compared the features of Google's operating
system](http://webconverger.com/about/) to Webconverger. And I think I am
right!

Webconverger does not require any registration and you can now [download](http://download.webconverger.org/) the
latest 5.8 update! The differences can be seen from this package listing:

	vimdiff http://download.webconverger.org/webc-5.7.txt http://download.webconverger.org/webc-5.8.txt


The big difference with this release is that I experimenting by using **i686**
builds instead of **486**. This means that Webconverger will not boot on very
old PCs and some cheap CPUs like Geode. If this is problem for you, let me know! For the rest of us with i686 compatible hardware, Webconverger should be a litter **faster**.

In other news, the spelling from the previous release [[5.7_with_Firefox_3.5]] should now be working for you.

The [CJK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK) support might not quite work on
these free images, however if you [purchase
Webconverger](http://webconverger.com/buy/) with Chinese (or Korean or
Japanese) support I will ensure all the relevant fonts and input tools are
pre-installed.

Thank you and [[thanks|acknowledgements]] to the Debian project and [Debian
Live project](http://debian-live.alioth.debian.org/) contributors to make
Webconverger possible.
