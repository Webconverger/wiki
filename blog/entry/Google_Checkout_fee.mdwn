When Webconveger first started using [Google
checkout](http://checkout.google.com) it was free, which was nice. I can't
remember when Google Checkout UK started charging transactions fees, I guess at
the end of 2007.

Until May 2009 they charged Webconverger 1.5% + 0.15. So on 100GBP, Google's cut was 1.65GBP.

Google's checkout fees have increaded to 3.4% + 0.20 on Monthly sales below
1500GBP. So Google's cut will increase to 3.6GBP. More than a 100% increase.
That's a big greedy [Google](http://www.google.com/finance?q=GOOG).

So what are the alternatives?

* [Paypal](http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_display-receiving-fees-outside) charge 2.9% + $0.30 USD
* Worldpay use [complex pricing](http://www.worldpay.com/corporate/content.php?page=pricing&c=UK)

After enquiring Worldpay say:

	Our new business offer is:
	Set-up Fee: £75
	Monthly Fee: £15 each month (first month payable upon application).
	Credit and Debit card charge is 3.35% + 15p per transaction.

There must be better ...
