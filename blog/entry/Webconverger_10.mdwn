Next year February will mark oddly the 5th year of this opensource project and
software business.

Without further delay may I present Webconverger 10 with an accompanying site
redesign by [Patric Schwarz](http://www.bureauschwarz.de/).

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6536515073/" title="Webconverger 10 by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7167/6536515073_308522ee6f.jpg" width="500" height="366" alt="Webconverger 10"></a>

At [[changes/9.0-10.2]] you will notice the usual flash update, [Firefox
8](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/8.0/releasenotes/), additional firmware
for ralink [[wireless]] and quite a few removed packages.

The removed packages are mostly unnecessary for _trying_ Webconverger. I think
it's better to customise Webconverger with your chosen locale than altering the
boot menu and then choosing the appropriate dictionary once Webconverger is
booted. Likewise printing is best left as a customisation option, as it makes
the initial download a bit too bulky otherwise.

10.2's sha1sum is `8f0770175c2b237814715ce7e4ccd99044502d10` and you can
[download it here](http://download.webconverger.org/).

There are a couple of other additions in this release that warrant blog posts
in the near year. 2011 has been a very busy year for me personally. The good
news is that I hope to spend much more time with Webconverger in 2012.

Here is to a successful 2012 for you and Webconverger! Cheers :)
