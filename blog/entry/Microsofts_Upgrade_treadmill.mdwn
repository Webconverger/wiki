# Webconverger's lifetime subscription

Webconverger is making a unique offer that no other operating system vendor is
making.

If you buy a subscription for your hardware, we promise to support that machine
**forever**. As long as our company survives.

The only caveat is that a lifetime "one off" subscription is fixed to a
particular machine identity and is non-transferable.

Webconverger provides more than just an Windows operating system. We provide
everything upto the browser and ensure it is tested and patched with the

If you think your hardware will last more than two years, we highly recommend

page](http://webconverger.com/pricing/).
