which impedes the competitiveness of PCs and makes Microsoft a monopoly.

[Windows XP support ends April 8, 2014](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/endofsupport.aspx)

What does "support ends" mean? It means that running a Windows XP machine after
this date will **expose you to security risks** because Microsoft
will not be providing ongoing security patches.

You are then typically faced with a [decision to spend 150USD per computer to

# Webconverger's lifetime subscription

Webconverger is making a unique offer that no other operating system vendor is
making.

If you buy a subscription for your hardware, we promise to support that machine
**forever**. For as long as our company survives.

The only caveat is that a lifetime "one off" subscription is fixed to a
particular machine identity and is non-transferable.

Webconverger provides more than just a windowed operating system. We provide
everything up to the browser and ensure it is tested and patched with 
[[security updates|security]].

If you think your hardware will last more than two years, we highly recommend
our one off offer as documented on the [pricing
page](http://webconverger.com/pricing/).
