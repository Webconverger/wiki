If you buy a PC you are inevitably sold a Microsoft license with it. You may
assume you are getting "Windows for free", though the fact is you are paying a
[Microsoft tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundling_of_Microsoft_Windows),
which impedes the competitiveness of PCs and makes Microsoft a monopoly.

[Windows XP support ends April 8, 2014](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/endofsupport.aspx)

What does "support ends" mean? It means that running a Windows XP machine after
this date will **expose you to security risks** because Microsoft
will not be providing ongoing security patches.

You are then typically faced with a [decision to spend 150USD per computer to
upgrade to Windows
7](http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/368088-any-good-articles-explaining-windows-xp-end-of-life-to-end-users),
unless you are one of the "lucky" few who can pay additional 200
dollars per year per box for [Custom
Support](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2047768/microsoft-will-still-patch-windows-xp-for-a-select-group.html).

However, [Windows 7 end of mainstream support ends in less than 500
days.](http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/search/default.aspx?alpha=windows+7)
And lets be honest, upgrading an Enterprise to a new Windows release is
absolutely non-trivial.

# Webconverger's lifetime subscription keeps your PC permanently patched

Webconverger is making a unique "PC hardware saving" offer that no other
software vendor is making. With Webconverger there is no need to retire an old
PC. We don't force you to upgrade at cost like Microsoft effectively does.

If you buy a subscription for your hardware, we promise to support that machine
**forever**. For as long as our company survives.

The only caveat is that a lifetime "one off" subscription is fixed to a
particular machine identity and is non-transferable, as described in our
[[Terms]].

Webconverger provides more than just a windowed operating system. We provide
everything up to the browser and ensure it is tested and patched with
[[security updates|security]].

We will endeavour to make our software operating system not require more
resources as time goes on, like Microsoft does. We will endeavour to keep a
stable, simple and familiar browsing experience for many many years to come.

If you think your hardware will last more than two years, we highly recommend
you take advantage of our **one off** offer as documented on the [pricing
page](http://webconverger.com/pricing/).
