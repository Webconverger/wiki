[Daniel](http://blog.daniel-baumann.ch/) let me know there there is an
important [[flash_player|adobe]] security update 10.0.32.18+20090731.120040. The [only
difference](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/a8a472d97e01307f)
between [[5.1|blog/entry/Webconverger_5.1/]] and 5.2 is that updated
proprietary package.

Webconverger takes security seriously and we are <http://ocert.org/team_and_members.html>.

If you spot any security problems please email <security@webconverger.com>. [[Thanks_everyone|acknowledgements]]!
