Yikes! I only just noticed from the [[acknowledgements]] that Webconverger that is more than a year old.

I began working on Webconverger in February 2007, though it was only in July 2007 Webconverger as a company was formed. This year February 2008 Webconverger became VAT registered which should make it easier to do business with [European Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU) companies.

I've just uploaded some new versions of [[maxi]]. This excites me as the [CJK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK) or [[i18n]] support is excellent in [[maxi]]. Want to try out a Japanese environment? Simply append `locale=ja_JP.UTF-8` to the [[boot]] options. Unfortunately, truth be told, not many CJK people seem to use Webconverger.

Webconverger's [[marketing|press]] in the English language is lacking and even worse for Asian markets. However there was a recent success story. A [Canadian library](http://www.yourlibrary.ca/) who has Chinese speaking patrons contacted me to tell me how great Chinese support is. So that's great news. :)

When [visiting China](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/140068125/) a couple of years ago I was astonished to see [BBC news](http://news.bbc.co.uk/) blocked. That's why I integrated [Tor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28anonymity_network%29) in the past into [[maxi]]. I intended to do a little publicity stunt and give copies to athletes attending the [Beijing Olympics](http://en.beijing2008.cn/). However since [China has unbanned BBC news](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7312240.stm) I don't feel the need. I've also dropped Tor from [[maxi]]. Tor was a bit of beast and there are simpler methods of getting around the [Great Firewall of China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China).

Recently a fairly **large** deployment was [Sport Relief](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_Relief) in the UK. AFAIK Webconverger was used as a client to a Web application to take donations details during the telethon. So that should be proof enough that Webconverger is fairly mature, tried & tested for a one year old.
