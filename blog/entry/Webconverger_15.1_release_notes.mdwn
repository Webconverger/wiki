Our new automatic [[upgrade]] feature released in [version
15](http://webconverger.org/blog/entry/Webconverger_15_release_notes/) works
well. [Git-FS](https://github.com/Webconverger/git-fs) has helped us
[[develop]], [[debug]] and [[test|testing]] better, and deliver to you an
experience that improves every day. Just like the Web does.

[Install
users](http://config.webconverger.com/faq/#what-do-you-mean-by-live-version-and-install-version-?)
don't have to do anything to get these new features. Live users should
[download](http://webconverger.com) 15.1 and ideally switch to the install
version by installing it to your hard drive.

What's new:

* New `hosts=` feature for simple internet blacklist/whitelist [[filtering]]
* [Font hinting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_hinting) for smoother page renders
* Faster browser boot times
* Feature and security updates to [Firefox to 16.0.2](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/16.0.2/releasenotes/)
* Security update to [Adobe Flash player 11.2.202.243](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb12-22.html)
* Various updates to the underlying [Progress Linux](http://progress-linux.org/) system

For more details, `git log --oneline --decorate 15.0..15.1` on the [chroot](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/16.0.2/releasenotes/).

## Commercial customised ISOs service with your embedded configurations return

Webconverger Limited's commercial service to have the ISO pre-configured is
back and hosted at <http://custom.webconverger.com>. This is a very
convenient way to deploy on machines with [[wireless]] only network connections, or
on a large number of machines. Please contact sales to learn more.
