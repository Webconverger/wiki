I am pushing up Webc 3.2 mini now. This returns the [[pdf_viewing|adobe]]
feature I mistakenly left out the [3.1 mini package
list](http://download.webconverger.com/mini/webc-3.1.mini.txt). This happened
because the [[Webconverger_and_WebKit]] release I made at that time did not
support inline [xpdf](http://packages.qa.debian.org/x/xpdf.html).

The next big [[todos|todo]] as ever is to get:

* the hard drive installer working
* include [[wireless_networking|networking]]

The hard drive installer milestone is a bit too complicated for me and I am
dependent on [Daniel](http://www.daniel-baumann.ch/) to look at this again on
my behalf. Tbh I have been a little hesitant to roll out this feature as I
feared I would get "Webc installer destroyed all the contents of my hard disk"
type emails. Webconverger as a Live CD is about protecting people from (over)
writing _any_ data. To the astute previous work described in [[Debian_Web_Kiosk]] paves the way for a hard drive installer in any case, so the installer
is coming along... very slowly.

As for wireless [[networking]], I have my own little solutions, however they
work for me and my particular hardware and wireless setup. Wireless hardware
and wireless setups are awfully complex. I am quite envious of Apple's slick
Iphone wireless interface. Writing something like that with
[wpasupplicant](http://packages.qa.debian.org/w/wpasupplicant.html) might be
possible. So far my efforts could be described in a [linux haters blog
rant](http://linuxhaters.blogspot.com/).

The good news in 'wireless networking' is that [3G USB dongles in the
UK](http://gadgeteer.org.uk/tag/usb-modem/) or
[EVDO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EVDO) as seems to be referred to in the
states looks like an excellent achievable new feature for Webconverger.

[I personally dial into 3G internet via bluetooth via my Nokia](http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/2278783255/) and it works
quite well. USB dongles are usually simple serial line modems that simply need
a ppp dial up script and some polish. However I still need to get "borrow" one
of these dongles to implement support. I will contact Vodafone or perhaps trial
with T-online.

I can't quite decide whether to move from [[boot]] `/proc/cmdline` options and
run a local httpd like [thttpd](http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/) and run a
"control panel" Web application to configure elements of Webconverger.
