Webconverger 19 brings you in terms of effort put in:

* [[Printing]] support completely **overhauled** with a new `printer=` API
* Restored nvidia WebGL acceleration using driver version 313.30
* New `support` API which allows customers to send us their complete (non-browsing) logs for study to http://support.webconverger.com/[MACHINE_IDENTITY]
* Raft of package upgrades
* New `prefs=` API, to override Firefox preferences, typically used for omitting print headers
* [Firefox 20](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/20.0/releasenotes/) updates and Flash security updates
* Tweaks to our Firefox kiosk extension (version 45)

## Printing properly supported

Thanks to a government client, who needs to print off Ricoh printers, we have
greatly improved our [[printing]] offering.

[Ricoh Singapore](http://www.ricoh.sg/contact.aspx) kindly helped us improve
support by giving us access to their smart "Printer Innovation Center", where
we tested several of their printers with Webconverger successfully.

I would like to thanks Wiemin Zhang and Sam Hon for hosting me there. I look
forward to working together to improve printing support for enterprise
deployments of Webconverger.

## Printing to PDF file server possible

If you are need to archive Webpages to PDF (for evidence for example), our
[[printing]] page has a tutorial telling you how to setup a "cups-pdf" service.

This mechanism could also be used to review a PDF before printing it. So a
Internet cafe user could print to PDF to an administrator's machine and then
proceed to pay the administrator before printing it out. This workflow allows
you to accurately preview a the PDF before printing it.

Here is a [sample PDF](/img/printing.pdf), printed using Firefox 20 and a
CUPS-PDF version 2.6.1 service.

For all the details `git log --oneline --decorate 18.0..19.1` on our unique
[[upgradable|upgrade]] [git maintained
chroot](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc).
