[[!meta title="Hiding the boot menu"]]

In deployments where it is desired to hide the boot menu, it is recommended you
simply **install** Webconverger to disk.

Subsequent boots will then boot straight into Webconverger without prompt,
making Webconverger effectively locked to its
[remote](http://config.webconverger.com) or preset configuration.
