I'm venting my opinion about user interfaces in light of [Aza Raskin's concept post](http://azarask.in/blog/post/firefox-mobile-concept-video/).

For me there are (broadly speaking) **two categories** of [user interfaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interfaces):

* Non-overlappying [tiles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager)
* Overlapping (floating) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_(computing)">windows</a> aka the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)">WIMP</a> paradigm

[Microsoft Windows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) made err...
the **windows** style interface familiar to millions of people, though I think
there are problems with **windows**:

* Different sized windows aren't useful, esp. very small ones.
* Dragging items between windows usage paradigm is not that common ([copy&paste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut%2C_copy%2C_and_paste) is easier)
* Managing different windows is hard, esp. when they overlap. Clutter!
* **Popup windows suck**
* Hidden / obscured / dragged off screen windows suck

So if I am right, why aren't we seeing **tiled** user interfaces?

Well I believe most people nowadays know _tiled user interfaces_ as
[tabs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabbed_document_interface). And we
hopefully agree that browsers have made tabs and tiled windowing paradigm
pretty mainstream.

Safari on the Iphone is also basically a _tiled user interface_ too and I like
it. I think Apple's Web UI is the **right paradigm** for browsing on mobile
devices.

In my experience 'designers' don't really understand scalable / resizable user
interfaces.  Traditional designers know
[A4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size) and exploit such print dimensions
to showcase their work.  So again forcing designers to think at fixed intervals
of screen sizes like 480Ã—320 in the case of the Iphone works. Windows doesn't.

If you're a Linux user (Ubuntu maybe?) and you want to try the tiled UI
paradigm for more than just your browser (Firefox), give the excellent
[dwm](http://www.suckless.org/wiki/dwm/about) window manager a try. It's
what Webconverger uses. :)
