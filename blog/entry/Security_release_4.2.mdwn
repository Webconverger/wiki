[Recently we've been made
aware](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/60d62ae72fcff707)
that the [[extension|kiosk]] that locks down Webconverger can be removed by
installing another extension. That's a serious security bug and thank you for
the report!

Hence the [4.2 security release](http://download.webconverger.com/mini) which [fixes this XPIinstallConfirm issue and
also disables
about:config](http://git.webconverger.org/?p=iceweasel-webconverger.git;a=commitdiff;h=3e5ca0b9212152ca55a693844e5d698d916ce8be).

The packages are refreshed from Debian lenny, including an important browser
[security update
3.0.5](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.0.5/releasenotes/). To find out
which packages have been updated, try:

	vimdiff http://download.webconverger.com/mini/webc-4.1.mini.txt http://download.webconverger.com/mini/webc-4.2.mini.txt

Next week I hope to have some more improvements like the 'Compose key' and resolution setting `xvideomode=` working again.

Webconverger takes security very seriously. You are welcome to mail the [user
