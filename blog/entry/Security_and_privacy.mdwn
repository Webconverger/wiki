Another year, another archive key so you know the 7EEFD8EC key is from Webconverger.

	4198 920B 166E 4256 B26E  E6AB E3C6 58D6 7EEF D8EC

So following Daniel's example [except the change in repository
layout](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/6c7b7a2989b942b8)
I have updated the [Webconverger archive
key](http://debian.webconverger.com/archive-key.asc).

If you track [[todo]] you'll notice I've added _IN DAILY_ to:

* disabling right click
* setting the UA to Firefox 2
* disabling the [[wireless]] convenience feature to join any open AP -- [a bad default](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/e746409c50e0a9a/040b5a1920f8e024)

_IN DAILY_ ? What does mean? That means the bug has been fixed or rather in
testing in the [daily builds](http://build.webconverger.org/), though not in
the proper tested official [release](http://download.webconverger.com/) yet.

As you all know with the uncustomized free version of Webconverger you can
alter the [[boot]] options and remove `nosudo` to activate **debug mode**. From
here you could run:

	sudo apt-get install tor iceweasel-torbutton privoxy
	sudo su -c "echo forward-socks4a / localhost:9050 . >> /etc/privoxy/config"
	sudo /etc/init.d/privoxy restart

This might help improve your privacy from the lunacy of the [EU Data Retention
Directive](http://www.openrightsgroup.org/2009/04/06/data-retention-endangers-democracy/).
I personally find using
[Tor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)) unusable. It's just
too slow. So in this case I don't think technology will save us. You should
instead politely lobby your local European government representative.
