Recently I noticed some people trying to get around Webconverger's [customisation business model](http://www.openbusiness.cc/2007/07/30/finding-your-feet-in-an-internet-business/) by building Webconverger themselves.

A treacherous path to follow instead of [enslaving me to do the build](http://webconverger.com/buy/). :)

In case you do try to build Webconverger, have a look at the [recent changes](http://webconverger.org/recentchanges/) to the wiki and see the [[todo_list|todo]].

Who said you had to be ruthless to do business?

But seriously, [I do (selectively) try help people actually build Webconverger](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/topics) as I would like more [[people_to_contribute|acknowledgements]]. I can't do everything. Just running the company takes more time than development time. :/

New feature I just implemented is [[no_screen_blanking|blanking]] in [webconverger-base](http://git.webconverger.org/?p=webconverger-base.git;a=blob;f=home/webc/.xsession). No time for re-freshing the builds currently.
