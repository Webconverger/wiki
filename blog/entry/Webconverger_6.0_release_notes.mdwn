Hah! I've discovered a way of [showing you the
changes](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2013091/coloured-diff-to-html) from
[[5.9_to_6.0|changes/5.9-6.0]].

The red bits are the removed packages, so you can see Webconverger has lost
some bloatware in the new year. :)

Also we are back on **486** kernels, meaning wider hardware support at the cost
of a negligible performance gain to 686 machines.

Please consider purchasing the [customised
version](http://webconverger.org/features/) to support the project. I will
offer a 50% **refund** this month if you photograph your customised
Webconverger in use and allow me to use your images.

[Download](http://download.webconverger.org/) and enjoy! Happy 2010!
