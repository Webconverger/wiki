14.1 fixes a [very embarrassing
problem](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/issues/65) with the installer,
whereby `unsquashfs` was accidentally removed. If you don't install
Webconverger to disk and use the [Live
version](http://config.webconverger.com/faq/#what-do-you-mean-by-live-version-and-install-version),
there is no need to upgrade from 14.0.

Some of you might notice the size of image 209M is much smaller than the 459M
of webc-14.0.iso. The `.git` folder present in the last releases was removed in
this 14.1 release for two reasons:

* It was bloating the size of the final image
* You can't reasonably automagically upgrade to the upcoming git-fs based version 15.0 from 14.x, so there is no point in having this extra baggage

Please help [[testing]] the **future** [[upgradable|upgrade]] version, that
uses own home grown [git-fs technology](https://github.com/Webconverger/git-fs)
from the [daily build site](http://build.webconverger.org).
