12.3 is another hugely exciting release for us.

# A [simple installer](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc/install-to-disk.sh)

Selecting the new installer option from the boot menu will **wipe the contents
of your hard disk** and put Webconverger on it. This is fantastic for large
installs.  Since most machines come with a hard drive, you can go around armed
with a USB key with 12.3 on it and get each machine converted to a public Web
kiosk in 5 minutes. The speed is largely dependent on how fast the disk is.

Note that once converted (Webconverger is installed), there is no undo switch,
you need to re-install the operating system on there previously. Therefore if
you have any doubt, **please** stick with the live version. It's designed not
to touch your hard drive. The live version is perfect for deployments where you
might just want to turn your PC into a kiosk temporarily.

# Other changes

We have fixed some important issues surrounding the configuration service and
the way the client retrieves a configuration from us. If
<http://config.webconverger.com/> is blocked on your network for example,
Webconverger will now timeout after 15 seconds. Previously this would take much
longer thanks to the `wget` default retry behaviour that took us off guard.

There are no package changes between 12.2 & 12.3 hence there is no package
diff. However there are
[changes](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commits/master) in the
[[kiosk_extension|kiosk]] to disable `about:home` which could potentially be a
vector for attack and breaking out the lock down.

# Risks to your [[privacy]]

We enabled
[updates.sh](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc/updates.sh)
which allows us to run arbitary **signed** code on the client. This let me
remind you is true of any other update system in any other operating system.
The difference here is we are being transparent about it.

This script gives us flexibility for supporting customers, such as being able
to collect logs to debug issues. Of course this is a [[privacy]] concern since
we could "after the fact" install code to monitor a browsing session, which you
will have to trust us, we won't do.

* You can disable this by appending `noupdates` to [[boot]] command line
* You could block <http://updates.webconverger.com>

How do you know what we are doing to your machine? If you know your UUID, you
can visit <http://updates.webconverger.com/YOUR_UUID/manifest> To see what code
would be run on startup.

We also added some [code to check if the signing keys have been
revoked](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc/updates.sh#L44),
so that if something happens to the key, we can disable them to limit any
potential "what is the keys fell in the wrong hands" scenarios.

If you think we have made a mistake with our [[security]] approach, **please**
let us know.
