[Webconverger Neon](http://neon.webconverger.com), Webconverger's spin off Web
signage operating system product was introduced [[earlier on this
blog|Webconverger_Neon]], however there wasn't a version for you try, until
now.

[Download Webconverger Neon](http://neon.webconverger.com/neon.iso) for
evaluation. Please follow the [Webconverger USB install instructions with the
downloaded ISO](http://webconverger.org/usb/).

The current version is `neon-eval-dd361e0.iso` with the `sha1sum`
`dfca9ee0434486569e8c2a3897e7cd51a1dde0bc`. The package listing is at
<http://neon.webconverger.com/neon.txt>.

The remote monitoring features have been disabled. The evaluation product is
free to try for one week providing you have a
[Paypal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal) account.

Next we are looking for tighter integration with [[hardware
vendors|Kiosk_hardware_partners_sought]] and Web signage platform (for
authoring the HTML of a sign) vendors like [Rise
Vision](http://www.risevision.com/partners/) to better solve client deployment
problems.

Though for now, I hope you are as excited as we are about the potential of the
Web on digital signs in public places. The [interest in Web
signage](http://www.w3.org/2012/06/signage/minutes.html) of late has been
fantastic. The Web offers powerful open way to inform people on the go and
Webconverger aims to be the software service company to deliver it on your PC
hardware.
