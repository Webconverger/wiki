Some aspects of Webconverger do seem daunting for deployment and we are aiming
to create [Webconverger tutorial videos](http://www.youtube.com/webconverger/)
to help you.

In this video, I demonstrate how to change the boot order in order to boot from
the USB stick, instead of the hard drive. In this scenario you can keep
whatever is installed on the hard drive and use Webconverger as long as there
is a USB stick with Webconverger on it, inserted into the PC.

If you like the videos, please let us know. We are keen to hear from you how we
can improve them. For example here are our [[production_notes|screencasting]].
