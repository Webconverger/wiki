As we did with the [[Kioware_Product_Comparison]], let's compare Webconverger
against [Provisio's SiteKiosk](https://www.provisio.com/en-US/SiteKiosk).

Like [[Kioware|Kioware_Product_Comparison]]
[SiteKiosk](https://www.provisio.com/en-US/SiteKiosk/Default.aspx#system) is a
Windows based solution based on Internet Explorer. Webconverger is an operating
system, so you don't need Windows and we ship the Firefox Web browser that
offers a better surfing experience than Internet Explorer.

SiteKiosk has [four versions](https://www.provisio.com/en-US/SiteKiosk/Default.aspx#version) to compare to:

* Quality - Webconverger is opensource software based on quality peer reviewed Linux, Xorg & Mozilla code
* Worldwide leader - Webconverger is used by [almost 3000 machines every month](http://ping.webconverger.org) and the #1 Opensource kiosk
* Patented Technology - Webconverger is [against software patents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patent_debate#Arguments_against_patentability)
* 12 months free updates - yes, as long as you are subscribed you can easily upgrade
* Configuration tool - yes, we have a basic configuration Web form to be filled in once Webconverger boots
* OS & Browser lockdown - yes
* Auto start + Shell replacement - yes, though this is really only applicable because they depend on Windows
* Scheduled shutdown & restart - yes, in [[cronjob]]
* System reset after idle time - yes, this is the same as [[kioskresetstation|blanking]] feature

* SiteCaster - yes, though in the [Neon](http://neon.webconverger.com/) product, not Webconverger
* Large selection of browser skins - no, we don't do this. Skins are usually a performance killer, how we do offer [[bgurl=|artwork]] for simply branding the background

* On-screen keyboard - [yes, though not currently enabled in default builds](http://config.webconverger.com/faq/#does-webconverger-support-touch-screens)

* Print station with PrinterOn - no, please refer to [[printing]]

Webconverger seems most similar to SiteKiosk Basic priced at 149USD for 12
months of free updates.  Excluding the
[[cost_of_Windows|Comparing_to_our_competitors]], Webconverger beats SiteKiosk
on that price for the first year with our 100USD annual fee. SiteKiosk allows
customers to run without updates after the first year, though we feel
continuous updates are vital for kiosk security and ensuring a continually
improving Web user experience.

Webconverger solves the same security for public access computers problem
better, beats SiteKiosk on price, [[faster|requirements]] and easier to deploy.
