# Roadmap

As outlined in [[Avoiding_the_Microsoft_upgrade_treadmill]], we are keeping a
conservative outlook. We are working on a kernel update so you don't have to
worry about issues like this [new hardware
issue](https://twitter.com/webconverger/status/377335412538101760) effecting
the current kernel 3.8 we have.

[Please download the latest release](http://dl.webconverger.com/latest.iso) and we would love to hear from you!
