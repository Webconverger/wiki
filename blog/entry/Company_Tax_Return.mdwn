Webconverger Limited (incorporated 11th September 2007) is filing (or
'returning') its taxes for the first time (Not to be confused with an
[[Annual_Return]])! The dreaded corporation tax deadline is January 2009 and
evidently you must **pay** before you submit the report in April. Confused?

Armed with my [compromised UK Government
Gateway](http://p10.hostingprod.com/@spyblog.org.uk/blog/2008/11/government-gateway-usb-memory-device-with-passwords-and-source-code-found-in-a-p.html)
account details, I can pay [Corporation
Tax](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/corporation-tax) via a Web application. There
seem to be quite a few [third party
tools](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/efiling/ctsoft_dev.htm) to file taxes, though a
quick peek doesn't excite me.

The strategy for Webconverger I will adopt is this:

1. Collect all bank statements and Google checkout orders
* Give them to accountant (print and email)
* Talk to accountant about how to pay the least tax possible
* File taxes online using my Government Gateway account (not going to fiddle with agent access)

Since I've never filed taxes before, I'm prepared to pay an accountant for
advice as I would hate to be penalised for some novice mistake.

Stumble to step one. There seems to be no sane way to print statements from the
Barclays business account. I do not keep any statements as I shred them once I
receive them. I've begged Barclays to stop killing trees and threatening my
security by sending me statements, but they will not listen to me. Their
business adviser doesn't return my calls. Oh, I loathe Barclays.

Right, I'll export the data as
[CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) which alarming
Barclays think is Excel data. Ok, seems like I have all entries there. Rename
data.csv as 2008.csv. Data portabilty is not hard! Oh wait, the Barclays CSV
seems close to unreadable. Oh dear.

Next, Google checkout. Ok, I have [complained to Google about exporting
checkout
data](http://groups.google.com/group/google-checkout-uk/browse_thread/thread/1049515cc972693f/e13d8b7ac7f56c2d?#e13d8b7ac7f56c2d)
and hopefully it's now easy. Hmm, **no**, it still seems I can only [export my
data a month at a time!](https://checkout.google.com/sell/orders) :(

Oh man, [cloud
computing](http://natalian.org/archives/2008/10/29/come-down-from-the-clouds/)
sucks so bad. Ok, lets write a shell script:

	#!/bin/sh
	. ./secret.sh
	for YEAR in 2007 2008
	do
	for MONTH in $(seq 1 12)
	do
	LASTDAY=$(echo $(cal $MONTH $YEAR) | awk '{print $NF}')
	XML=$(cat << END
	<order-list-request xmlns="http://checkout.google.com/schema/2" start-date="$YEAR-$MONTH-01T00:00:00" end-date="$YEAR-$MONTH-${LASTDAY}T23:59:59"></order-list-request>
	END)
	test $DEBUG && echo $XML
	curl --data "$XML" https://$ID:$KEY@checkout.google.com/api/checkout/v2/reports/Merchant/$ID
	done
	done

Phew, lucky I'm a computer science Masters graduate who knows how to workaround
HORRIFIC XML APIS. Still I am missing all customer data from:

	Google Order Number,Merchant Order Number,Order Creation Date,Currency of Transaction,Order Amount,Amount Charged,Financial Status,Fulfillment Status

Ok, next. How do I print CSV to study with my Pakistani accountant? This is
what I bought a [[printer|blog/entry/Samsung_SCX-4200]] for! I can't just send
the CSV text file to my accountant as an email attachment. That would be too
easy. :)
