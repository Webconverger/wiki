Happy new year 2012! As I prepare a [Firefox 9 based release](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/9.0/releasenotes/) which is already
available in [daily builds](http://build.webconverger.org/) for [[testing]], I
thought I should quickly document here a feature I failed to document, [USB
tethering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethering) in a [10.2
change](http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=blobdiff;f=webconverger/config/includes.chroot/etc/network/interfaces;h=3369f92e1a9902ea409dc295e33d0d0ed6f34fe1;hp=d8618a15db9f8ea8039a86df10df190164e5ed10;hb=2291c5f29dbfc7fd2c31c3eeb3e7ab0f8a9288ef;hpb=f32bb2dad13c095d4df93a99fa1b9827c3572d0f).

If you plug in a suitable USB network device that comes up as **usb0** and has
a simple dhcp mechanism, like the Android **USB Tethering** feature, you can
can get on the net.

This can unfortunately be a little fiddly since Android disables the USB
tethering if it doesn't detect the USB connection. Therefore on Android you
need to turn on the tethering feature everytime on booting Webconverger. Other
USB dongles might have a better experience.

Nonetheless with a USB stick with Webconverger, a microUSB cable & an Android
phone (with a data plan) you can setup a kiosk pretty much anywhere. Think
outdoors during a public [fÃªte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%AAte), a
local community site could introduced.
