Happy new year 2012! As I prepare a [Firefox 9 based
release](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/9.0/releasenotes/) which is
already available in [daily builds](http://build.webconverger.org/) for
[[testing]], lets introduce a feature I failed to document on
[[Webconverger_10]] release, [USB tethering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethering) in
this [10.2
change](http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=blobdiff;f=webconverger/config/includes.chroot/etc/network/interfaces;h=3369f92e1a9902ea409dc295e33d0d0ed6f34fe1;hp=d8618a15db9f8ea8039a86df10df190164e5ed10;hb=2291c5f29dbfc7fd2c31c3eeb3e7ab0f8a9288ef;hpb=f32bb2dad13c095d4df93a99fa1b9827c3572d0f).

When you plug in a suitable USB network device that comes up as **usb0** and
has a simple dhcp mechanism, like the Android **USB Tethering** feature,
Webconverger will detect and use this network interface.

This can unfortunately be a little fiddly since Android disables the USB
tethering if it doesn't detect the USB connection, for example when a kiosk is
turned off. Therefore on Android you need to turn on the tethering feature
everytime on booting Webconverger. Other USB dongles might have a better
experience.

Nonetheless with a USB stick with Webconverger, a microUSB cable & an Android
phone (with a data plan) you can setup a kiosk pretty much anywhere. Think
outdoors during a public [fÃªte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%AAte), a
local community site could be introduced from a laptop.
