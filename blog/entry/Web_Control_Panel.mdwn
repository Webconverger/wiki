Since I seriously began developing operating systems when I lived in
[Korea](http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/tags/korea/), I have had this idea for
an operating system with an interface like:

	http://localhost/halt
	http://localhost/upgrade

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2954897797/" title="webconverger/upgrade by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2277/2954897797_bd6837eb6d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="webconverger/upgrade" /></a>

To have an idea is one thing, though to carry the idea out is quite another!
After years of procrastination on my part, the basic functionality has been
checked in with the help of the lightweight httpd
[nostromo](http://www.nazgul.ch/dev.html). To try it out you can experiment
with [3.6 beta maxi releases](http://download.webconverger.com/maxi/) or try
out the [dailies](http://build.webconverger.org/) from today.

Browsing to [http://webconverger](http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/2954897791/),
will give a list of some options you can try out.

A post about this [Web API on the mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/d698ee201117c298#).

Of course the security must be better. Super user commands www-data should be
defined in `/etc/sudoers`. Perhaps a prompt for at least `/halt` should be in
place before I do a proper release. Please consider the concept for now and let
me know whether you like it or not.
