Just uploaded a new version 3 beta of [[maxi]].

Webconverger has pretty AMAZING [[i18n]] support. That means after adding a locale in the [[boot]] option [`locale=ja_JP.UTF-8`](http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/2502506953/) you get a Japanese Web kiosk. Easy.

This is great to play around with exotic [CJK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK) characters and inputs. Select a text box and [scim](http://www.scim-im.org/) (an input switcher) will be activated with [Control]+[Space]. Pretty impressive huh?

Trouble is, I don't hear of many people from the [CJK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK) part of the world. :(

The only time I heard that Chinese people love Webconverger, was from a library in Canada. Come on guys, you're **welcome on the open Web platform**. I'm happy to see many [Chinese are already using UTF-8](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/moving-to-unicode-51.html), which is great news. If you're Asian and find the fonts or some other rendering looks bad, **please** let me know.

Update: 3.0beta2 now has an easy to use Grub menu on the CD [[iso]] version.
