7.0 marks a huge milestone for the Webconverger browser only operating system,
since the Debian base system has upgraded from "lenny" to "squeeze".

The [[6.2_to_7.0|changes/6.2-7.0]] has several highlights such as:

* From Firefox 3.5.8 to [3.6.12](http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/firefox/3.6.12/releasenotes/)
* From [Splashy](http://packages.qa.debian.org/s/splashy.html) boot animation to [Plymouth](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Plymouth)
* From [[Adobe]] Flash 10.1 to Flash 10.2
* Faster booting thanks to [Debian Live](http://live.debian.net/)'s [live-boot](http://live.debian.net/devel/live-boot/) and [live-config](http://live.debian.net/devel/live-config/)

There has been a [community discussed privacy
change](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_frm/thread/45d2483f1f983993),
whereby Webconverger 7 reports its version to a [ping
service](http://ping.webconverger.org/hgweb.cgi/file/tip/index.php).

[Download now](http://download.webconverger.org) and [[burn to CD|iso]] or
[[image to a USB stick|usb]] to boot your machine to just a browser.

## New customisation services

For those who offer their clients only a [[webcfullscreen|kiosk]] experience,
Chrome can be used instead of Firefox. Further [chrome options are not yet
implemented by
Google](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=23145). Firefox is
still recommended, since it's more stable.

A Google checkout alternative Paypal form is now available on the basic
[Webconverger customisation purchase page](http://webconverger.com/buy/).
