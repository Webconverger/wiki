# Going forward to [[upgrades]]

So we have a problem and that is some folks aren't upgrading to the latest
release. For example the first 12.0 release is unfortunately hammering our
server for configurations that don't exist.

The **future** install version will magically `git pull` and update, but in the
meantime we are all a little worried about the folks that setup their kiosk
with the "live version" and just leave it running. For years.
