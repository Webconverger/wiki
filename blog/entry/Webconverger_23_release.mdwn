This 23.0 release is probably our last snapshot for 2013, one that should help
turn your PCs into Web kiosks or [Web digital
signs](http://neon.webconverger.com/). Happy holidays!

# What's new?

* Linux 3.10 kernel for increased hardware compatibility
* [Firefox 26](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/26.0/releasenotes/) and Flash updates
* A change to make installed version upgrades and downgrades more bandwidth efficient
* BUGFIX: When using a non-English locale, Accept Language headers are properly set. So for some Web applications, pages will be automatically in your language!

Some of these changes were [previously announced on the mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/webc-users/97Ony_c5eHc/JVaR89iwXUIJ), so
