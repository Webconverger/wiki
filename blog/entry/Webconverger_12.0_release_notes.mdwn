Webconverger 12 is the biggest leap forward this project has ever made. Highlights:

* Operating system innovation, [entire operating system is now maintained under git](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc) (we believe this is a first!)
* [New configuration and subscription service](http://config.webconverger.com/faq) at making it much easier to customise your kiosk
* [New boot menu](http://webconverger.org/boot/), with the ability to boot in a selection of different locales
* [Firefox 10 Extended Support Release](http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2012/01/10/delivering-a-mozilla-firefox-extended-support-release)
* A new **about:** page that shows the running version of Webconverger
* Even better browser lock down in <https://github.com/Webconverger/iceweasel-webconverger/> and no more search bar
* Much better network handling
* Re-engineering of [[boot]] APIs like [[i18n]]
* `kioskresetstation` works with [blanking](http://webconverger.org/blanking/)
* Incredible amount of hard open sourced work documented on <https://github.com/Webconverger/>
* [[12.0 package_changes|changes/11.2-12.0]]

# New configuration service offering from Webconverger.com

As we [[announced_earlier|Webconverger_11.2_release_notes]] this replaces
<http://webconverger.com/buy> customisation service which simply wasn't
scalable. There is an extensive [FAQ](http://config.webconverger.com/faq/)
describing the service, though the biggest caveat is that it only works on
[wired network
connections](http://config.webconverger.com/faq/#how-do-i-configure-my-wireless-connection)
on this Live version.

To give you an idea of how painless it is now to subscribe to the service,
please see this [video on subscribing](http://vid.ly/7w2p7e) and how easy it is
to [unsubscribe](http://vid.ly/0o5w5f).

Please checkout out the [FAQ about why your company should please purchase a
subscription](http://config.webconverger.com/faq/#what-does-a-subscription-buy-exactly).

Last but not least, <http://webconverger.com> now has a signage product based
on Webconverger called [Neon](http://neon.webconverger.com/) that is on the
[streets of the London](http://neon.webconverger.com/case-study/) now and will
be used at the [Olympic games](http://www.london2012.com/)! Open technologies
FTW!

# A binary operating system in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">git</a>

We have now laid down the foundations for an operating system **entirely**
managed in git. There is a lot more innovation to come in form of
[[upgrades|upgrade]] and getting the size down of the ISO down.  So we really
need your feedback and support in future rounds of [[testing]] hard drive
installs since is this is new territory.

Special thanks to Patrick Haller, Jamie Kitson, Guttorm Flatab√∏, Ruth Chong and
Paul Craig for your help, duly [[acknowledged|acknowledgements]].
