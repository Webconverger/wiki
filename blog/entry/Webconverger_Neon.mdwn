Webconverger is a community project funded by Webconverger Limited, which in
turns powers are fledging commercial services for [Web
kiosks](http://webconverger.com/) and digital signage, which is known as
[Webconverger Neon](http://neon.webconverger.com/).

Most digital signs you see today in your city are not online and are not on the
Web. We hope to change that working together with
[Renew](http://renewsolution.com/) who are really pushing the envelop with Web
signage. They aren't innovating just anywhere, they have Webconverger Neon
deployments all over the very heart of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London">London's square mile</a>!!

So in the picture above I was very excited to see them on the [streets of
London](http://neon.webconverger.com/case-study/) and I hope to see this trend
continue.

Community users of Webconverger could give yourself a slap on the back too.
Since we know Webconverger is stable and reliable because we have nearly [3000
users](http://ping.webconverger.org/) who effectively help test our releases.
