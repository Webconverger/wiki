[[!meta title="Downgrading an OS with git"]]

In a series where I hope to get you excited about the innovations Webconverger
are doing, I'm going to profile what possibilities a [git maintained
rootfs](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commits/master) can realise.

The ugly truth with all Linux distributions except Webconverger is that
downgrading is non-trivial. You can only "upgrade" your way out of trouble. You
could fetch old packages from say <http://snapshot.debian.org> though you could
get easily run into some dependency problem. Then once you've managed to
downgrade you need to put holds on the downgraded which then you probably
forget about them and wonder why things don't properly upgrade from there.

Just imagine a downgrade is as simple as a `git revert`... well it is with Webconverger!

Take this particular <a href="https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/issues/16">issue #16</a> as an example. I performed
an upgrade which was found to be the cause of font rendering problems, which
incidentally corresponded to [Debian bug
666736](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=666736). I simply
reverted that particular change and now we are back on track for a new release
with another
[innovation](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/webc-users/bDgGe--4TNQ/discussion).
