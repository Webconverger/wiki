Yesterday I was surprised to see Python in the [[packages_list|txt]]. That's bloatware.

I fealt very stupid when I found [webconverger-base depended on Python](http://git.webconverger.org/?p=webconverger-base.git;a=blob;f=debian/control). Woops!

Then I found out that [ALSA sound support depends on Python](http://packages.debian.org/lenny/alsa-utils). Doh. :/ How can I remove Python from ALSA?

It gets worse. I had in mind to implement a [wpasupplicant](http://packages.qa.debian.org/w/wpasupplicant.html) Web interface with shell CGI with perhaps [mini-httpd](http://packages.qa.debian.org/m/mini-httpd.html). However wpasupplicant depends on [libpcsclite1](http://packages.debian.org/lenny/libpcsclite1) which in turns pulls in tons of dependencies with [pcscd](http://packages.debian.org/lenny/pcscd). A slipperly slope indeed.

[Debian Live](http://debian-live.alioth.debian.org/) has a wonderful little hooks section `chroot_local-hooks` and I added [stripped](http://git.debian.org/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=blob;f=mini/config/chroot_local-hooks/stripped).

One of the most important software quality is **less code**. Another similar movement is [suckless](http://www.suckless.org/wiki/) and armed with [sloccount](http://packages.qa.debian.org/s/sloccount.html) you go to work. And then you work, rework and add new features. If you manage to have less lines of code than what you started with, then you're following the principle of less code.

So it feels particularly good to make Webconverger shed dependencies and lines of code from 3.0 beta 2 as you can see in either [[mini]] or [[maxi]] download sections.
