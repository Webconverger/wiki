Yesterday I was surprised to see a [Python](http://python.org/) in the [[packages_list|txt]]! A silly mistake is to use Python instead of simple shell when writing system scripts. You can even use [shell for Web stuff](http://dabase.com/e/04041/). :)

I fealt very stupid when I found [webconverger-base depended on Python](http://git.webconverger.org/?p=webconverger-base.git;a=blob;f=debian/control). Woops! Fixed.

Then I found out that [ALSA sound support depends on Python](http://packages.debian.org/lenny/alsa-utils). Doh. :/ How can I remove Python without killing the music?

It gets worse. I had in mind to implement a [wpasupplicant](http://packages.qa.debian.org/w/wpasupplicant.html) Web interface with shell CGI with perhaps [mini-httpd](http://packages.qa.debian.org/m/mini-httpd.html). However wpasupplicant depends on [libpcsclite1](http://packages.debian.org/lenny/libpcsclite1) which in turns pulls in tons of dependencies with [pcscd](http://packages.debian.org/lenny/pcscd). A slipperly slope indeed.

[Debian Live](http://debian-live.alioth.debian.org/) has a wonderful little hooks section `chroot_local-hooks` and a [stripped](http://git.debian.org/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=blob;f=mini/config/chroot_local-hooks/stripped) example that helped Webconverger get on a diet.

One of the most important software quality metrics is **less code**. Another similar movement is [suckless](http://www.suckless.org/wiki/) and armed with [sloccount](http://packages.qa.debian.org/s/sloccount.html) you go to work. And then you work, rework and add new features. If you manage to have less lines of code than what you started with, then you're really following the principle of less code. :)

So it feels particularly good to make Webconverger shed dependencies, [[packages|txt]] and lines of code from 3.0 beta 2 as you can see for yourself in either [[mini]] or [[maxi]] download sections.
