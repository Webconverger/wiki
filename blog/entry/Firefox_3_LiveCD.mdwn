Since [Firefox 3](http://getfirefox.com/) is now official, I've made Webconverger 3 official. Try the latest [3.x webc-mini release](http://download.webconverger.com/mini/).

I actually prefer the LiveUSB version. [Download](http://download.webconverger.com/) *.[[img|usb]] and checkout the [[instructions_for_putting_Webconverger_on_your_USB_stick|usb]]. Boots in a minute on my Thinkpad X40!

There probably will be some [[bugs|blog/entry/Bugs]] (also see [[todo]]) so please report them to the [mailing list / forum](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/topics) or directly to me if you so wish. For the more technically inclined, see [Iceweasel bugs](http://bugs.debian.org/src:iceweasel) and [Mozilla's BTS](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/).

Enjoy and congratulations to [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/) on the historic bit of PR which is [download day](http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2008/06/18/over-8-million-way-to-go/).
