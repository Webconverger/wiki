Since [Firefox 3](http://getfirefox.com/) is now official, I've made Webconverger 3 official.

So burn webc-3.0.mini.iso to a CD to effectively try Firefox 3 in a safe Live environment.

I actually prefer the LiveUSB version. [Download](http://download.webconverger.com/) webc-3.0.mini.img and checkout the [[usb]] for instructions for putting Webconverger on your USB stick. Boots in a minute on my Thinkpad X40!

There probably will be some [[blog/entry/Bugs]] so please report them to the [mailing list / forum](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/topics) or directly to me if you so wish. Thank you.
