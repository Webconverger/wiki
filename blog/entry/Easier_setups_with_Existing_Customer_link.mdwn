If you have more than a couple of subscriptions with us, you probably have
access to the Configuration control panel:

Previously it was a bit tedious to copy and paste in the case senstive machine
identity. Now there is a "Existing Customer" link from the default
configuration page:

That allows you to put in your ID to immediately add that machine identity to.
So it takes just a few seconds to setup machine after machine with the default
Webconverger ISO. No special [customised ISO](http://custom.webconverger.com/)
required!
