11.0 was a great & popular release. Thank you! 11.2 builds on that with:

* [Firefox 10](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/10.0/releasenotes/)
* Linux 3.2 with [TCP Proportional Rate Reduction](http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_3.2#head-1c3e71416a9fdc2f59c1c251a97963f165302b6e)
* Removal of confusing tab groups from Firefox, making things simpler
* Stop accidental downloads of unknown mimetypes, therefore saving precious bandwidth
* For developers: Build upgraded to [live build a42](http://packages.qa.debian.org/l/live-build/news/20120115T204939Z.html) from [Debian Live](http://live.debian.net) and [source has moved to Github](https://github.com/Webconverger/)
* 10 second retry on [net Error](https://github.com/Webconverger/iceweasel-webconverger/blob/master/content/netError.xhtml#L410), for cases where network isn't quite ready
* More (non-free) wireless firmware: realtek, libertas, brcm80211 & atheros, means your [[wireless]] kiosk will almost certainly work :)

## Making upgrading to the latest releases **easier**

Webconverger strives to be a simple [[secure|security]] kiosk solution. Saving
you time and headaches. Although Webconverger is well protected (being read
only for example) from many browser vulnerabilities that arise, it is still
best security practice to be up to date. Not only that, your users will
appreciate the better HTML5 support and speed improvements in Firefox.

We know that [[upgrading|upgrade]] Webconverger is painful with these frequent
releases & no automatic updating:

1. Download latest ISO from <http://download.webconverger.com/>
2. Re-imaging USB stick or burning entirely new CD
3. Re-deploying to physical machines

Conservative customised users are often much less enthusiastic about the
upgrade process above and can't easily justify the full
[cost](http://webconverger.com/buy).

Firstly Webconverger will reduce the cost of an image update to _existing
customers_ by 50%, providing there are no additional customisations and the
customer is kind enough to provide a testimonial. So a photo of Webconverger
(could be anonymous) in use in your institution and 50GBP if you have already
had a customised image, based say on version 10, that you want today on 11.2.

The [order form](http://webconverger.com/buy) will be updated soon to reflect
this new strategy.

## Moving to a subscription based model and to a sustainable future

In the next weeks a new development project will kick off whereby we will
enable some persistence (saves the updates, i.e. not read only anymore) in the
[[USB]] images to enable efficient updates to the squashfs images of
Webconverger. Here the business model will be a _subscription based_ one.
Further details such as the price of such a convenient service has not been
finalised.

Webconverger as a business needs a regular income and I hope you can understand
and support this direction. Any questions or comments? Please email
<feedback2012@webconverger.com>.
