As documented in the [[API]] page, `http_proxy=IP:PORT` is used to specify a proxy.

Ideally you organisation uses a [transparent
proxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server#Transparent_proxy) where this
configuration is not necessary.

In the video above I demonstrate typically how you would set Webconverger up
for a [oroxy server](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server).  However a
potential problem is if you boot from an [install
version](http://config.webconverger.com/faq/#what-do-you-mean-by-live-version-and-install-version)
your proxy might not allow direct access to <https://config.webconverger.com/>,
meaning you won't get your proxy configuration applied.

In this case you need to hold the Alt or Shift keys to get a `boot:` prompt to
pass the appropriate `http_proxy=` line, as mentioned on the [[debug]] page.
Again ideally your network can be configured to always allow access to
<https://config.webconverger.com/>, so that special configurations like a proxy
server can be retrieved successfully and applied.
