Seasons greetings! Apologies for the delayed security release, that is **5.9**.
I have been enduring a cold and
[BT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_telecom) [20CN 'professional'
broadband which limits me to 3GB of traffic between 9am-6pm for the
MONTH](http://aaisp.net/broadband-units.html) in [Cornwall,
UK](http://prazefarm.co.uk)! Yes, it's almost 2010! And that also means the
feedback email address has been updated to &#102;&#101;&#101;&#100;&#098;&#097;&#099;&#107;&#050;&#048;&#049;&#048;&#064;&#119;&#101;&#098;&#099;&#111;&#110;&#118;&#101;&#114;&#103;&#101;&#114;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;

So what has changed in **5.9** over [[5.8|5.8_release_notes]]?

* 0-day flash security update
* Bloated [GNU grub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_GRUB) is dropped on [[ISO]] which should mean wider hardware support
* [[hetty]] has been upgraded meaning quicker builds and [order](http://webconverger.com/buy/) turnarounds
* Unfortunately some bloat crept in (avahi, dbus, xorg-docs) -- will remove them later

Please report any issues that are not in the [[todo_list|todo]] on the friendly [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users).

Happy surfing!
