Lately [I have been enjoying using Firefox 3](http://natalian.org/archives/2008/04/14/go-faster-mozilla/).

Though it's not explicit in the [[design_goals|design]], I do want to make
Webconverger as fast as possible. Firefox 3 leaves Firefox 2 in the dust, so I
think this is a good excuse for Webconverger to increment to the version three
milestone. :)

Please test webc-3.0b.mini (BETA) from the [[mini]] [download directory for the
beta](http://download.webconverger.com/mini/).

In order to prepare for this release
[dwm](http://git.debian.org/?p=users/kai-guest/dwm/.git;a=blob;f=debian/config/config.web.h)
and the [[Firefox_addon|kiosk]] was updated, amongst other things.

For the time being, [[upgrades|upgrade]] are disabled, though I do aim to fix them in
future. I've updated the [[todo]] too.

If there is a particular feature there you want to see implemented you can
please [sponsor the work](http://webconverger.com/buy/) or at least drop a
pleasant request at the [Webconverger users
group](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/topics).

Have a [safe surf with Webconverger](http://webconverger.com/)!
