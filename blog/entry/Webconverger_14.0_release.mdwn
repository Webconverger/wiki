We have been hard at work this summer and 14.0 marks several major enhancements:

* New: 686 kernel, which should show better performance on multi-core hardware
* New: nVidia 302.17 support via [bumblebee](https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project) & [VirtualGL](http://www.virtualgl.org) for easing deployment
* New: [Mozilla Firefox 14.0.1](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/14.0.1/releasenotes/), using the **official** distribution
* New: `noclean` option for deployments where the default clean slate is not desirable (e.g. Granny's bungalow)
* New: `swarp` API for mouse positioning, many thanks to the [suckless community](http://suckless.org)
* Update: [Critical Flash update](https://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb12-18.html) [11.2.202.238](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commit/b9fc0cf7e6f25c962f17e2f28bc3bc171b160e7e)
* Fixes: Better `xrandr` screen handling, try for portrait `xrandr-all=--rotate%20right`
* Fixes: [[Time synchronization|cronjob]] doesn't alter the BIOS clock
* Fixes: Logging tweaks to increase signal over noise
