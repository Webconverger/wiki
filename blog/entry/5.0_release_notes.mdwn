5.0 is minor point release with a small grub boot menu correction (hard drive
installer option shouldn't be displayed when it's not available!) and an
updated xulrunner.

Once [Firefox in Debian](http://packages.qa.debian.org/i/iceweasel.html) 3.5
hits unstable, there should be some backports and a much more exciting release
will be made. The Webconverger [[kiosk]] addon for Firefox is being overhauled
for 3.5, which should address some problems on the [[todo]] list.

I'll be in [Debconf9](http://www.debconf.org) next week in Spain and I hope to
at least get the Debian installer working again for us.
