Webconverger 17.0 is exciting for two reasons:

1. New installer, allowing you to install to a USB (more on this)
* Whole base is upgraded. squeeze/artax &rarr; wheezy/baureo

# Installing to a USB stick, a "Keyosk"

Admittedly this is a little confusing but please bear with, since the "install"
term can be mis-interpreted as a straight copy or image. [Install in
Webconverger parlance means you are creating a read/write
store](http://config.webconverger.com/faq/#what-do-you-mean-by-live-version-and-install-version-?).

When you follow the [[USB_guide|USB]] you are:

1. Downloading the ISO
2. dd-ing, that is plonking the image upon the USB stick, without partitioning the USB stick (this is tricky)

The new installer allows you to **format** the USB stick, take up the entire
partition (tricky bit solved) and use it as a read/write store. This is
powerful because now a **Webconverger installed USB stick can download updates
to itself**. You don't need to install to hard drive to enjoy the zero
maintenance joys of an always uptodate installation.

So the steps are now for an USB **installed Webconverger**:

1. Downloading the ISO
2. dd-ing, that is plonking the image upon the USB stick A - see the [[USB_guide|usb]]
3. Boot stick A, and choose "Install Webconverger"
4. Insert stick B (2G+ recommended)
5. Choose to install to stick B
6. Now boot from **installed** stick B, which is now able to update itself!

# Major base upgrade

For those who are already using the [installed version of
Webconverger](http://config.webconverger.com/faq/#what-do-you-mean-by-live-version-and-install-version-?)
upon their hard drive, you have just moved ~2 years into the future. Absolutely
seamlessly thanks to a our innovative home grown gitfs [[upgrade]] technology.

You can see the extent of the upgrade from 16.0 here upon [[17.0
package_changes|changes/16.0-17.0]]. Introducing a 3.7.x Linux kernel and new
technologies such as [systemd](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd).

What does this mean? This means newer hardware will be far better supported.
Previous issues with the [[NUC|Next_Unit_of_Computing]]'s video rotation and
sound are now fixed and it works great. Many of you will notice [WebGL working
in
Webconverger](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/sdk/demos/google/shiny-teapot/index.html)
across many different types of hardware.

To see a detailed list of changes run `git log --oneline --decorate 16.0..17.0`
upon the [curated chroot](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc).
