Webconverger 17.0 is exciting for two reasons:

1. New installer, allowing you the choice to install to a USB stick
* Whole base is upgraded. squeeze/artax &rarr; wheezy/baureo

# Installing to a USB stick, a "Keyosk"

<img src="/img/17.0-install.jpg" alt="Webconverger 17.0 Install options">

The "install" term can be mis-interpreted as a straight copy or image. [Install
in Webconverger parlance means you are creating a read/write
store](http://config.webconverger.com/faq/#what-do-you-mean-by-live-version-and-install-version-?).

When you follow the [[USB_guide|USB]] you are:

1. Downloading the ISO
2. "dd-ing", that is plonking the image upon the USB stick, without partitioning the USB stick (this is tricky)

The new installer allows you to partition (tricky bit solved) the USB stick and
use it as a read/write store. This is powerful because now a **Webconverger
installed USB stick can download updates to itself**, as long as there is space
on the disk. You don't need to install to a hard drive to enjoy the zero
maintenance joys of an always uptodate installation.

So the steps are now for an USB **installed Webconverger** (using two USB memory sticks A&B):

1. Downloading the ISO
2. Plonking the image upon the USB stick A - see the [[USB_guide|usb]]
3. Boot stick A, and choose "Install Webconverger"
4. Insert stick B (2G+ recommended)
5. Choose to install to stick B
6. Now boot from **installed** stick B, which is now able to update itself!

# Major base upgrade

For those who are already using the [installed version of
Webconverger](http://config.webconverger.com/faq/#what-do-you-mean-by-live-version-and-install-version-?)
upon their hard drive, you have just leaped ~2 years into the future.
Absolutely seamlessly thanks to a our innovative home grown gitfs [[upgrade]]
technology.

You can see the extent of the upgrade from
[[16.0|Webconverger_16.0_release_notes]] upon [[17.0
package_changes|changes/16.0-17.0]]. Introducing a 3.7.x Linux kernel, a raft of video driver updates and new
technologies such as
[systemd](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd).

What does this mean? This means newer hardware will be far better supported.
Previous issues with the [[NUC|Next_Unit_of_Computing]]'s video rotation and
sound are now fixed and it works great. Many of you will notice [WebGL working
in
Webconverger](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/sdk/demos/google/shiny-teapot/index.html)
across many different types of hardware.

To see a detailed list of changes run `git log --oneline --decorate 16.0..17.0`

Update: Firefox
[18.0.2](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/18.0.2/releasenotes/) with this
[JS stability bug fix](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=831626) will be
incorporated into Webconverger after testing, hopefully tomorrow. Install users
will upgrade to this efficiently and automatically.
