I've just released [Webconverger 2.37](http://download.webconverger.com/mini/),
based on the new [lenny](http://www.debian.org/releases/lenny/) release, though
without the [earlier promise of
splashy](http://webconverger.org/blog/entry/Lenny_in_with_a_splash/). This
means Webconverger is even more likely to _just work_, especially on newer hardware.

I have not setup splashy because I've yet to decide on the new [[artwork]] to
use. I'm also toying with the idea of **not having a splash screen** at all as
it is useful to see network information and update information. Though I have
received complaints that the black screen of text scares people... :/

My [designer friend Hawken King](http://dadako.com/) (and old fellow QuakeWorld
TF-er) has contributed some designs. Which one do you like? Please help me
decide via the feedback form on [Webconverger.com](http://webconverger.com/).

Thank you!
