So what's new with 4.9?

	vimdiff http://download.webconverger.org/webc-4.7.txt http://download.webconverger.org/webc-4.9.txt

* Shows a new Iceweasel (Firefox) [security update 3.0.11](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.0.11/releasenotes/)
* Back to [[xpdf|adobe]] despite printing dialog problems, because it's lighter and integrates better with the browser (no EULA to agree to everytime!)
* [webconverger-base](http://git.webconverger.org/?p=webconverger-base.git) 4.9 featuring [[wireless_essid_with_spaces_fix|wireless]] and a [[compose_key_option|boot]]. Read the [back story on the forum.](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/b1b9c26b2bd4eaf3)
* Webconverger should be synced by Internet time, hence you shouldn't see SSL warnings if your BIOS clock is wrong.
* You don't have to hold down the button on newer machines. Webconverger should understand ACPI "power down" events, that your computer should send on physically pressing the power button momentarily.
* Known to work flawlessly with a cheap EEEPC900! [[Many_thanks|acknowledgements]] to [Ben Armstrong](http://syn.theti.ca/) and Guttorm Flatab√∏!

# Known issues

* Hard drive installer is not present on the [[ISO]] version (or the [[USB]] media for that matter)

Download is first made available on the [German mirror](http://download.webconverger.org/) and is syncing now slowly with the [Californian mirror](http://download.webconverger.com/).
