Webconverger Limited came very close to exhibiting at a [Kiosk conference in
London](http://www.kioskcomeurope.co.uk/) earlier this month.

An ally [Jake](http://twitter.com/jstride) over at [Tactile
CRM](http://www.tactilecrm.com/) gave me some good advice: "Don't exhibit at a
conference you've never attended."

So I only attended KioskCom 2008 UK in Olympia London and saved the company
1000+GBP. :)

* Best designed exhibit goes to [GWDMedia](http://gwdmedia.com/) based in Sheffield
* Most impressive hardware had to be the massive [Samsung touch panels](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2920148616/in/set-72157607962182483/)
* Device that most surprised me was the [WIFI kiosk](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2920148520/in/set-72157607962182483/)

So this conference has quite a corporate feel to it. I attempted to seek out
Linux based solutions though I found none. Kept on finding [Windows
Embedded](http://www.windowsembedded.com) everywhere. Oh no.

Webconverger's current [price point](http://webconverger.com/buy/) of 100GBP
makes it a hard sell. As Windows Embedded licenses I heard go for max 50GBP.
Usually a **lot** cheaper as Microsoft is determined to keep its monopoly.

Most vendors there were hardware sellers, selling an assortment of kiosk
hardware where of course Windows embedded has been tested with. Just getting
hardware vendors to try Webconverger on their hardware seems difficult.

People tell they used to have stability/reliability problems with Windows
Embedded, now it's less of a problem.  So crikey, how can Webconverger compete?

Where is Windows weak? Naturally I thought **security**. I could argue that
Webconverger has better [[security]]. Though after picking up a brochure on
Windows Embedded, Microsoft do a very thorough job of getting across an albeit
exaggerated "Trustworthy Computing" message across. Slick.

Microsoft also pitch
[Silverlight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight), [Windows
Presentation
Foundation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation) &
Internet Explorer 7. It's quite a stack and they are also careful to assure
customers their XP solution will be available till [December
2016](http://xppro2016.com/).

Whilst Microsoft has serious competition on the Desktop PC & Mobile
(Apple&Android smackdown) platforms... I see the kiosk market being quite a
challenge. Webconverger makes Linux Web kiosk deployments much easier than they
used be and we at Webconverger will endeavour to make it even easier.

There is lots [[todo]] and we need your support and advice on <a
