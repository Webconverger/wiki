16.0 showcases the proven <abbr title="Digital Out of Home">DOOH</abbr>
[Neon](http://neon.webconverger.com/) Web signage <abbr title="Operating
System">OS</abbr>, under the new `chrome=neon` switch to Webconverger users.
The only difference now really between the
[Neon](http://neon.webconverger.com/pricing/) and
[Webconverger](http://webconverger.com/pricing/) products, is the extra
monitoring offered in Neon, which would not be appropriate in Webconverger for
[[privacy]] reasons.

Neon's pricing model at 30USD a month, works out at just 1USD a day per screen.
You hopefully can generate at least 1USD of revenue on your screen per day by
advertising a service or product!

What's new:

* New `chrome=neon` and black background Neon theme
* New `homepage=` expansions for WEBCID, WEBCVERSION & finally USBID for simple physical authentication in <abbr title="Point of Sale">POS</abbr> use cases
* New `noescape` option for further locking down of install boot
* Update [Firefox 17.0.1](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/17.0.1/releasenotes) and flash update
* Bug fixes for [https_proxy](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/issues/92), [[xinput|touch_screen_calibration]] and [disabling addons](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/issues/112)

Those using the install version, your will enjoy safely and silently
[[upgrading|upgrade]] to these new features and fixes.  Verify the update if
you like by cross referencing the `about:` version with the [latest
