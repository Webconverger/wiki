The new [[easy-to-use|training]] installer is now part of [[mini]] by default.
So [downloading the latest mini](http://download.webconverger.com/mini) (> 3.4)
you will be presented with an option in the Grub [[boot]] menu to install
Webconverger to your disk. By default Webconverger is a safe Live CD that will
not touch the existing contents of your disk.

Sooner than later you will be simply prompted to confirm whether or not to replace the contents of your disk:

Installation is actually quite fast:

Perhaps in a couple of minutes you should finally see:

Now you're ready to take out the CD ISO and start installing Webconverger on the next PC. :)

If you don't want the default homepage to be [portal.webconverger.com](http://portal.webconverger.com/) for your particular deployment, then please utilise the [customisation service](http://webconverger.com/buy/).
