`kioskresetstation=5` as a [[boot]] parameter will configure Webconverger to reset after five minutes of inactivity.

A [bug has been reported whereby Webconverger would not start properly without
a key press after a
reset](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/39cf0cca0e1d8038/2381878f7f3b2759).
Trouble is most people didn't experience this bug at all. Sometimes I would see
it. Other times I wouldn't. This is why I removed the bug from the
[[bug_list|TODO]] only to see it reappear later.

In hindsight, the **key press** gives the bug away. Though I spent many days
thinking it was a problem with my
[code](http://git.webconverger.org/?p=webconverger-base.git;a=tree;f=kioskresetstation).
I even wrote my own little C program to detect user inactivity. Finally I
narrowed it down to Iceweasel, as Webkit's GtkLauncher did not have this
problem.

After some [debugging](http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/2852122333/) by removing `nosudo` from the [[boot_paramenters|boot]] I finally found the bug.

The browser was blocking on a read for random numbers!
[/dev/random](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random) is the proper random
number generator in Linux and gives generally quite good numbers. However it
uses random events like **key presses** in order to work. Obvious now isn't it?

Solution: I will probably try removing /dev/random and symlinking to /dev/urandom, which is less likely to block.
