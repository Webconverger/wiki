A beta release of Webconverger 3.3 [[mini]] which features the long awaited **hard drive
installer** has been painstakingly uploaded on a
[[slow_British_Internet_connection|UK_fibre_optic]]. :)

Simply boot the Webconverger Live 3.3 CD, select "Install Webconverger" from
the [[boot]] menu and in a few minutes you should have turned your computer
into a **Web kiosk**.

The usual "ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY" waiver of liability applies. This is not yet
for complete novices as you can accidentally wipe the contents of your disk.
So for [[testing]] I do recommend something like
[VMware](http://www.vmware.com/). This installer preview does not quite work as
[[designed|design]] especially as there is no [[upgrade]] path!

Many [[thanks|acknowledgements]] to [Chris](http://chris-lamb.co.uk/),  Daniel and the [guys](http://alioth.debian.org/project/memberlist.php?group_id=30929) who pushed [Debian Live 1.0](http://blog.daniel-baumann.ch/2008/08/27#20080827_debian-live-lenny-beta1) out, on which Webconverger is based. :)

Spread the word and please [purchase Webconverger for your business](http://webconverger.com/buy/) as [[others|press]] already have. Enjoy!
