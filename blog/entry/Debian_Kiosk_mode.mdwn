So you're a super smart Debian/Ubuntu geek. :)

Here's a chance to impress when you have friends over. Hopefully your friends
like computers too and its usually via the familiar Firefox Web browser.

To save some blushes when your 'personal' Web history might be exposed whilst showing your friend's come cool new Web application...

Use **Webconverger**!

Add:

	deb http://debian.webconverger.com/ lenny/

To your '/etc/apt/sources.list'

	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install webconverger-base

You well then be prompted to install two packages:

	iceweasel-webconverger - the firefox extension to lock down the browser
	webconverger-base - the bits that create a private browser using webc

Install them. Now the fun part:

1. [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[F6] and login into tty6 with your usual username.
* `sudo su - webc`
* `startx -- :1`

Here we launch a seperate X session in the webc's user sandboxed space.

* [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[F7] should get you back to your normal X :0
* [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[F8] switches you to your second X :1

To quit and clean up, on your second X [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[Backspace] and:

	sudo apt-get remove webconverger-base iceweasel-webconverger

Webconverger aims to uphold your [[privacy]]. This is a initial release, so my clever Debian brethren, if you spot any [[security]] bugs in [webconverger-base](http://git.webconverger.org/?p=webconverger-base.git), do tell.

P.S. If you have no friends this Webconverger mode is good for porn. :)
