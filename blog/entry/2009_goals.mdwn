Webconverger [needs goals](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/01/08.html)
for 2009.

Besides fixing some annoying [[bugs|todo]] like being able to manually fix the
resolution, I would like to spend some time carefully polishing the install.
For example making sure any menus are locked down.

Another goal is to tweak the business model. I would like to move away from a
customisation model as it's ultimately silly to differentiate from your core
product for every order. Hopefully some administrator settings can persist with
some nice Web UI I have been working on behind the scenes.

To [tweet about Webconverger](http://twitter.com/webconverger) and only
Webconverger related stuff. I have been tweeting about me, myself and I. Sorry,
I got carried away. :)

To properly come up with a system on the Web that I like for doing business
accountancy and document the process on the [wiki](http://webconverger.org/). I
would like to see how far we can push that "open business" idea.
