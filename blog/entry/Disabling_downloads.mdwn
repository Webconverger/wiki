A [webconverger user pointed out that one could download and run files in
webc3beta2](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/cbd90c70b3b6fbf6).

This may be true, as [Firefox 3 has a new Download Manager which is also very difficult to disable](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Talk:Firefox:2.0_Download_Manager).

After a few hours of frustrating hacking and a lot of help from #extdev on
irc.mozilla.org, I have hopefully disabled the chance of a jail break via the
downloadManager. This (more) "locked down" behaviour should be better than what
it was in Webconverger 2.

webc-3.0b3.mini contains these improvements to the [[kiosk]] extension.
However, I have noticed that on my test machine (Thinkpad X40) ALSA sound
playback does not seem to work with these new images.  Does sound playback work
for you on [YouTube](http://youtube.com)? Please let me know.

Two steps forward, one step back. :)
