A very common question asked to <sales@webconverger.com> is whether we support
the [Rasbperry PI](http://www.raspberrypi.org/)? The answer is no, because I've
tried it and I think sadly the PI is too slow for Web browsing to justify the
man hours needed in making and maintaining the port. [Webconverger is Free
software](https://github.com/Webconverger), so I would love you to prove me
wrong.

Another common question I get asked is what specific PC hardware
Webconverger runs on. Webconverger should run on **any PC**. However it would
be good to point customers to a particular reference...

Enter the [Intel
DC3217IYE](http://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/us/en/desktops/dc3217iye-product-brief.html),
the <abbr title="Next Unit of Computing">NUC</abbr>, not to be confused with
the [Nook reader](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes_%26_Noble_Nook). I
purchased one yesterday for 450SGD with 4G of RAM from
[Video-Pro](http://www.videopro.com.sg/products/product_info.php?products_id=12330).
What I loved about this PC purchase is that I **was not forced to buy
Microsoft** Windows 7/8. Therefore saving 120SGD on Windows 7 OEM & hilariously
buying a 45SGD CD drive just to install Windows.

The NUC works right out of the box with [Webconverger
16](http://webconverger.org/blog/entry/Webconverger_16.0_release_notes/) which
is **fantastic**. There is still some further tweaks that can done, for example
getting WebGL working, [ensuring it can
suspend](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/issues/81) efficiently to save
power and ensuring sound properly works.

The NUC includes a [VESA
mount](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Display_Mounting_Interface) to make it
easy to mount behind a screen that shares the interface. Making it great for kiosk deployments.

For [Web signage](http://neon.webconverger.com/) deployments, where the screen
should be mounted ideally flat against the wall... well this is tricky. Be
great to hear if you have solved this problem. Unfortunately the NUC isn't
passively cooled, so one needs to be a little careful how it's installed.
Nonetheless comparing the beautifully small NUC to other signage hardware I've
worked with, including Intel's own [OPS
standard](http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/embedded/applications/digital-signage/ops),
the NUC looks like a God send.

Really looking forward to supporting Intel NUC based deployments with
Webconverger. The NUC is what I'll be recommending to customers for new
hardware purchases for both Webconverger kiosks and signage installs.
