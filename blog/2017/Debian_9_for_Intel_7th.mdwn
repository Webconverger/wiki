Webconverger customers let us know about issue running on:

* NUC7iBNK
* Dell Optiplex 7450s

Issues were LAN networking issues and video issues. This is a typical symptom
of a new Intel hardware generation, namely the **7th generation**. Recently
[Intel announced 8th
generation](https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/new-8th-gen-intel-core-processors-simplifying-today-opening-door-whats-next/).

Unfortunately each new hardware generation requires new drivers. I wish it
didn't, but Intel's drivers _do not seem to be always forward compatible_. In
the Linux ecosystem, this means an updated kernel and often [Xorg
drivers](https://packages.qa.debian.org/x/xserver-xorg-video-intel.html) to
support the new generation.

In Debian on which Webconverger is based, to get the latest kernel, you need to
often do an entire distribution upgrade. Since Debian releases are typically
frozen four years apart, it can be quite a [challenging upgrade
path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSHdqZAXOs0)!

We don't start from scratch, like re-installing a fresh copy of Windows. The
reason why is that we are keen to keep the differences down using our [git
maintained rootfs](http://github.com/webconverger/webc). Though over time the
position might become untenable. We've endeavoured to seamlessly support
upgrades for our customer base, but the problem is often a crazy amount of
work. Work that is manual and requiring a lot of test hardware. Worse is...
work that often completely unnoticed!

The transition from Debian 8 (Jessie) to Debian 9 (Stretch) was an enormously
stressful for me and I am thankful [Matthijs
Kooijman](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commits?author=matthijskooijman)
did such a great job. I laboriously ran as many tests as I could.

On [2017-09-06 I merged the 25805 file
changes](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/pull/234) and I haven't any
negative feedback so far... However the now [leader of Debian
project](https://github.com/Webconverger/Debian-Live-config/commit/89dcd1c4a59667611c6b69e6f6960f9b7a3d0ab3#commitcomment-24064994)
has noticed I have broken [[2016/Webconverger_has_reproducible_builds/]].

So this is another milestone for Webconverger. We've taken many users through
three major versions of Debian. I'm celebrating this release, the one you don't
notice. ;)
