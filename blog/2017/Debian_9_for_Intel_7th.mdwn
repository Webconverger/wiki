[[!meta title="Debian 9 for Intel's 7th generation"]]

Webconverger customers let us know about issue running on:

* [NUC7iBNK](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/product-briefs/nuc-kit-nuc7i5bnh-nuc7i5bnk-brief.pdf)
* Dell Optiplex 7450s

Issues were LAN networking and video issues. This is a typical symptom of a new
Intel hardware generation, namely the **7th generation**. We have been a little
fortunate that customers generally run our operating system on older hardware,
someone reducing these sorts of issues. Recently [Intel announced 8th
generation](https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/new-8th-gen-intel-core-processors-simplifying-today-opening-door-whats-next/).

Unfortunately each new hardware generation requires new drivers. I wish it
didn't, but Intel's drivers _do not seem to be always forward compatible_. In
the Linux ecosystem, this means an updated kernel and often [Xorg
drivers](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/xserver-xorg-video-intel) to
support the new PC generation.

In Debian on which Webconverger is based, to get the latest kernel, you need to
often do an entire distribution upgrade. Since Debian releases are typically
frozen four years apart, it can be quite a [challenging upgrade
path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSHdqZAXOs0)!

We don't start from scratch, like re-installing a fresh copy of Windows. The
reason why is that we are keen to keep the differences down using our [git
maintained rootfs](http://github.com/webconverger/webc). Though over time the
position might become untenable. We've endeavoured to seamlessly support
upgrades for our customer base, but the problem is... it's often a crazy amount
of work. Tedious work that is manual and requiring a lot of test hardware. Worse is...
work that often goes completely unnoticed!

The transition from Debian 8 (Jessie) to Debian 9 (Stretch) was an enormously
stressful for me and I am thankful [Matthijs
Kooijman](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commits?author=matthijskooijman)
did such a great job. I laboriously ran as many tests as I could...

On [2017-09-06 I merged the 25805 file
changes](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/pull/234) and I haven't had any
negative feedback so far... However the now [leader of Debian
project](https://github.com/Webconverger/Debian-Live-config/commit/89dcd1c4a59667611c6b69e6f6960f9b7a3d0ab3#commitcomment-24064994)
has noticed I have broken
[[2016/Webconverger_has_reproducible_builds/|reproducible builds]]. I will fix
it or again contract someone to do it, since I am super busy.

To conclude, we have now taken many users through three major versions of
Debian. I'm celebrating this release, the one you don't notice. ;)
