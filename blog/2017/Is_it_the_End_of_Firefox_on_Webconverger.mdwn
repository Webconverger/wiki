Firefox as the choice browser for the x86 version in Webconverger is fast
becoming in doubt. Reasons are:

1. Unable to lock down Firefox
2. Media playback has become a mess thanks to DRM

# Unable to lock down Firefox

For over 10 years, all the crazy malfeatures Mozilla have introduced have been
turned off via their extension/addon API and preferences. The
[webconverger-addon](https://github.com/Webconverger/webconverger-addon) is a
key component to Webconverger and without it, Firefox would be absolutely
unusable and unsafe in a kiosk or Enterprise environment (think public banking).

Over the years extensions have become [increasingly difficult to
debug/develop](https://github.com/mkaply/cck2wizard/pull/55#issuecomment-293578666) , [require signing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBIqpEFmfUI)
and after Firefox 52 are likely to completely replaced by the incompatible
[WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions).

Furthermore **WebExtensions** as it stands, appears to not have the APIs to
lock down Firefox. It's unclear how long "legacy" addon API will be supported
by Mozilla.

# Media playback

Some Webconverger customers have their homepage set to Spotify for example.
Spotify's Web interface used to require Adobe Flash which is distributed in
Webconverger.

The new way of playing back protected content is to click "Enable DRM" &
**download** a three megabyte Widevine CDM binary and **execute it**. Even if I
permitted this extremely questionable form of distribution, it [does not appear
to work](https://youtu.be/HxYIoWO4DoA).

Therefore I am tempted to tell my customers who require to playback DRM
content, that we cannot service them.

# The future

Thankfully there is ... [one other opensource browser](http://caniuse.com/) to
choose, but I am very reluctant to choose it. I fear if everyone runs _derived_
Webkit, the open Web which I have personally strived for most of my adult life
will be doomed.

Of course switching to <https://webkitgtk.org/> would not be easy. Various
elements like the powerful prefs [[API]] will have to go with Firefox, though a
minority of Webconverger customers use that.

To conclude, I am thankful for Firefox, they have had a good run and they
probably do need to let their software die and re-invent itself. However this
means turbulent times for Webconverger. I fear we will be distributing a
"security unsupported" browser for a period of time before a good solution can
be found. Thankfully the design [[security]] design of Webconverger does make
certain exploits impossible by keeping sessions isolated.
