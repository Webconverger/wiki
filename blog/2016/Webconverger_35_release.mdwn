# Kickstart Webconverger

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hqt66LOuuJE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

From yesterday, configuring a device **requires** payment authorisation. The
**new** [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) based billing system should make it
painless for new subscribers who have just one or two machines to purchase a
subscription.  If you do encounter a problem, _please_ email support.

The trial is 30 days and the initial price is 9.99USD a month. Our [pricing is
flexible](https://webconverger.com/pricing/) and for large deployments and for
the likes of [non-profits and
charities](https://twitter.com/webconverger/status/724971675708575744), we ask
you please to get in contact with <a
href=mailto:sales@webconverger.com>sales@webconverger.com</a>.

We are hoping this new revenue stream will give us the resources to tackle [our
issue list](https://github.com/webconverger/webc/issues), improve the Raspberry
PI & Android versions and grow.

# Is Webconverger still free?

Webconverger will always be opensource, meaning you can check out the source
code and [[fork|develop]] Webconverger. Unconfigured it's still the best
operating system to surf privately in my opinion.

But there is no such thing as free _of cost_ software. Since 2007 I've been
working on Webconverger, mostly part time alongside my full time employment.
However my circumstances have changed, I have a newborn sucking up all my spare
time and I need this to be full time and enough to meet a Singaporean
Employment Pass (5000+ SGD pcm).

Webconverger's value is to give IT managers a streamlined tool to provide the
Web in non-personal spaces so the public, students or business employees can
access the Web privately and securely. Every [commit we make is transparent &
open](https://github.com/webconverger/). We ensure everything is patched,
locked down and even go through lengths to [packet
sniff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Zmsj5DnQYo) our software to ensure
there are no leaks. Then we test Webconverger and test it again, and provide
timely support.

If you or your company share our values, please subscribe to our service or
just drop us an email if you can help. Thank you,
