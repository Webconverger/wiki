Webconverger needs money in order to survive and grow. It's come to stage where
I need to find a job otherwise and I'd rather work on Webconverger.

Supporting Webconverger in the past for many people who are configuring just
one machine has been "opt-in" since the "chasing up / quotation / invoice
raising" process didn't justify the cost.

Now we've invested some time [making the subscription process as easy as
possible](https://youtu.be/hqt66LOuuJE?t=123).

In the near future we aim to make it mandatory to have some payment method to
trial and configure Webconverger.

## Wait! Isn't Webconverger is supposed to be free?

Webconverger has never been free of cost. It's a full time job for at least one
diligent engineer. The software free as in freedom. You can take our body of
work at build it, and use it.
However we cannot support that endeavour & you cannot use our Web configuration
panel to manage your deployments.

## What's the price?

In line with our [current pricing](https://webconverger.com/pricing/) we are
charging 9.99 a month. If you an existing customer on a different rate, do get
in contact and we can provide you a discount.

Again if you deploy many machines, we can accommodate you without subscribing
individual machines and besides Stripe our payment provider only allows 25
subscriptions per customer.

## So what do you plan to do with the subscription money?

Supporting every developer requires approximately 300 subscriptions priced at
10USD a month.

We have a backlog of [issues](https://github.com/webconverger/webc/issues) we
want to tackle, as well as get the resources to improve the RaspberryPI &
Android.

If you care about the private Web browsing, we urge to support our effort. We
have been doing this since 2007 and we hope to do this long into the future,
with your support.
