With the arrival of free SSL certificates from [Lets
Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), together with a kind offer from [Fastly
CDN](https://www.fastly.com/) <a
href=https://www.fastly.com/network-map>(locations)</a> to help distribute
Webconverger since we are an opensource project, we are now serving our ISO
over SSL from <https://dl.webconverger.com/latest.iso>. If there is a download
problem, please get in touch & try this
[backup](https://webcdl.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/webc-34.0.iso).

So serving over SSL greatly reduces the chance of some malicious actor
intercepting your connection to our server and giving you a corrupt version of
our ISO.  That's never happened to our knowledge, though why not make it even
less likely going into the future?! The `sha256sum` is:
