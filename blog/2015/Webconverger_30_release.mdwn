As [announced on
twitter](https://twitter.com/webconverger/status/595525589861277697) earlier
this month, we achieved a significant technical accomplishment for Debian based
derivatives doing the dreaded dist-upgrade.

**A seamless upgrade**. No config changes. No hoop jumping. No sweat. If you
are running [the install
version](https://webconverger.com/faq/#what-do-you-mean-by-live-version-and-install-version)
that upgrades itself, you will now be based on Debian Jessie. The new "stable"
major [release of the underlying open Debian
platform](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases) for Firefox that will be the
basis for Webconverger for the next 3 years.

So we skipped version 29 and **30** marks the fact that we are on Debian Jessie
8.0. Hopefully the only difference you will notice is that this new release
should **run a bit better on newer hardware**. There is an unfortunate caveat
that if you are using a [486 kernel based Webconverger, your upgrade will not
go smoothly](https://twitter.com/webconverger/status/597244298707501056). We
noticed that most people using the 486 kernel were doing so mistakenly and
we've asked the _very few people that are affected_, to please simply
re-install with any version since 25. Usually you will find your machine to run
better, since it's taking advantage of 686 multicore architecture. So yes, we
are dropping 486 support.

The [detailed changelog between 28.0 and
30.0](https://github.com/webconverger/webc/compare/28.0...30.0) and of course
this release includes the latest [Firefox
38](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/38.0/releasenotes/) at time of
writing.

of a release.
