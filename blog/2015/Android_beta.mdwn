Android 5.0's new features such as [screen
pinning](http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-5.0.html#ScreenPinning)
and [managed
provisioning](http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-5.0.html#ManagedProvisioning),
has now enabled Webconverger to make a port without too much fuss of say
building a ROM.

At time of writing, the [current
release](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.webconverger.KioskApp)
is **beta software** and [we are looking for interested
testers](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/webc-users/qXZHvmk1Jgo/3B2lw0mnWqMJ)!

Why Android? Pros:

* Better [touch screen experience](http://webconverger.com/faq/#does-webconverger-support-touch-screens)
* In future we should be able to leverage Android's [IMEs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method) and support Korean, Japanese & Chinese inputs
* Android hardware is generally cheaper
* Android hardware is easier to deploy, especially in the <abbr title="Digital Out of Home">DOOH</abbr> use case
* Android is a better platform for pushing updates, by leveraging [Google Cloud Messaging](https://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html)

Cons:

* Not as fast an a desktop Intel PC type setup
* Touch screen keyboards aren't as good as a PC keyboard for form entry
* Android 5.0 (Lollipop) is not widespread yet
* The NFC [provisioning setup is a little clumsy](https://github.com/Webconverger/android/issues/3), but it does work. If you want it, ask us!
* Install and running the App without provisioning works OK, until you [get stuck on the lock screen](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=77775)!
* Updating and [supporting the platform forever like we do with the PC](/blog/2014/Webconverger_does_not_have_an_EOL/) cannot be achieved since we are at the mercy of Google

If you have an Android 5.0 (or above device), [check it out in the Play
store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.webconverger.KioskApp).
Now you can manage both Android and PC devices from a configuration panel!
