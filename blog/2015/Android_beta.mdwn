Android 5.0's new features such as [screen
pinning](http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-5.0.html#ScreenPinning)
and [managed
provisioning](http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-5.0.html#ManagedProvisioning),
has now enabled Webconverger to make a port without too much fuss, instead of say
building a ROM.

At time of writing, the [current
release](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.webconverger.KioskApp)
is **beta software** and [we are looking for interested
testers](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/webc-users/qXZHvmk1Jgo/3B2lw0mnWqMJ)!

Why Android? Pros:

* Better [touch screen experience](http://webconverger.com/faq/#does-webconverger-support-touch-screens)
* In future we should be able to leverage Android's native [IMEs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method) and easily support Korean, Japanese & Chinese inputs
* Android hardware is generally cheaper than PC hardware
* Android hardware is easier to deploy, especially in the <abbr title="Digital Out of Home">DOOH</abbr> use case. You could deploy on an ANDROID >=5.0 TV!
* TODO: Android is a better platform for pushing configuration updates, by leveraging [Google Cloud Messaging](https://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html)

Cons:

* Not as fast as a desktop Intel PC setup
* Touch screen keyboards aren't as good as a PC keyboard for form entry (call centre use case)
* Android 5.0 (Lollipop) devices are not widespread yet
* The NFC [provisioning setup is a little clumsy](https://github.com/Webconverger/android/issues/3), but it does work. If you want it, ask us!
* Installing from the Play store and running the App without provisioning works OK, until you [get stuck on the lock screen](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=77775). Note: This does not happen when provisioned!
* Updating and [supporting the platform **forever** (one off subscriptions) like we do with the PC](/blog/2014/Webconverger_does_not_have_an_EOL/) cannot be achieved since we are at the mercy of Google and the chosen update path of the hardware vendor

If you have an Android 5.0 (or above) device, [check it out in the Play
store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.webconverger.KioskApp).
Thare are other Web kiosk apps in the Google play store, though they are not
[Opensource like our effort](https://github.com/Webconverger/android/blob/master/LICENSE) is.  Now
you can simply manage both Android and PC devices from our [configuration
service](https://config.webconverger.com/)! That's a first!
