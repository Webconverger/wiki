Prompted by the [disturbing privacy defaults in Windows
10](https://jonathan.porta.codes/2015/07/30/windows-10-seems-to-have-some-scary-privacy-defaults/)
and an enquiry whether Webconverger leaked any intranet information, we
reviewed Firefox defaults.

This review was accomplished with [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/), a tool that
allows us to analyse every packet leaving and entering a Webconverger instance.

* [We did notice a lot of network noise chatter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVPiIruJ7rA) caused by safe browsing, location services & a media codec download
* [We reduced this chatter by turning off these automatic Firefox services](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyI8j85oqTw)
* [Finally, an upgrade process on an install was packet sniffed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Zmsj5DnQYo)

Strictly speaking these Firefox defaults don't leak any private information and
elements like [safe
browsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Safe_Browsing) should give an
extra layer of malware protection, but in practice the network noise generated
by these services are too risky for [[security]]. Some future exploit could
masquerade as one of the services we turned off and it would have been very
difficult to have noticed it otherwise. Furthermore "Safe browsing" doesn't
really have value when a typical Webconverger deployment is [[locked|kiosk]] on
a customer's homepage.

So our **quiet defaults** from version 32 can be overridden by your own Firefox
preferences with our `prefs=` API to turn them back on for example.

# Webconverger 32 with non-noisy defaults and ...

As mentioned what was coming next in [[Webconverger_31_release]], we did make
boots a few seconds faster by closing
[#220](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/issues/220)!

<https://github.com/webconverger/webc/compare/31.0...32.0> for details and
[Firefox 41](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/41.0/releasenotes/) is
included.

# No user tracking

In the course of comparing privacy defaults with our Windows competitors
such as [[Kioware|blog/entry/Kioware_Product_Comparison]] and
[[SiteKiosk|blog/entry/SiteKiosk_versus_Webconverger]], we did notice
disturbingly they have features to log where kiosk users surf to.

We don't and by design can't log user activity from our end for [[privacy]]
reasons. What we suggest customers do, is track the kiosk from their Web
analytics platform:

	homepage=https://example.com/kiosks/?id=WEBCID

You could then use that expanded WEBCID for tracking the particular kiosk on
your site.  Of course that strategy only **applies to Web sites the kiosk owner
controls**.

If you, the kiosk owner wanted to know how many visits a kiosk user makes of
for example Gmail, we can't tell you! Competitors allow you to do that, but we
don't because we don't want to infringe on the privacy of Webconverger users.
If you, the kiosk owner, don't want your kiosk users to go on other Websites,
you need to use one of our [[filtering]] options or simply use our [[user
interface without a URL bar|kiosk]] option.

We hope that our [[policy|privacy]] gives users more confidence to use
Webconverger branded kiosks in public spaces, since their privacy will be
respected if they decide to surf private Web sites.
