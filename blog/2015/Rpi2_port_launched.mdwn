On April 25th, we demoed and launched the [[Raspberry PI2 port of
Webconverger|rpi2]] at "Tech Saturday" with the following pricing:

The hardware is about 90SGD, making the software about 60SGD or 45USD. Which is
about 22% cost of the [PC pricing](https://webconverger.com/pricing/).

As a bundle and with <abbr title="Total cost of ownership">TCO</abbr> in the
sense this software will be updated into the future, this is **breakthrough
pricing** for getting into **Web signage**.

Webconverger is distributing the bundle in Singapore via
[12geeks](http://12geeks.com/). This saves the hassle of following several
[installation
steps](https://github.com/Webconverger/rpi2/blob/master/README.md) involved in
putting the software on a microSD card. If you're interested in the bundle,
please get in touch with sales!
