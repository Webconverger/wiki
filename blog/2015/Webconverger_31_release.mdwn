Two months ago was our momentous Jessie based [[Webconverger_30_release]] and since then we've:

* Fixed an issue with printing
* Pushed [Firefox 39](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/39.0/releasenotes/)
* Further locked down some new Mozilla anti-features like [social services, pocket and hello URLs](https://github.com/Webconverger/webconverger-addon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
* Received a fantastic endorsement from the (Internet) famous security pundit [SwiftOnSecurity](https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/620647975329468416)

# What next?

We could really do wtth your feedback, help & support on a couple of goals for
the next release:

* [Making wireless setups easier](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/issues/221)
* [Improve boot times](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/issues/220)
* Perhaps... work on efficient sharing a single machine with [multiseat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tp3P3qxdxU) is there is a demand for it!

If you can't code or have the time to, **please** [purchase a subscription](https://webconverger.com/pricing/)!

# Other hardware news

Managed to integrate the EETI eGalaxTouch driver for some models of resistive
touchscreens.  It works well as your can see by this [touch screen demo
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGoqzQtD4kg) and it's typically deployed
in Point of Sales in retail. Unfortunately the driver is in a private branch
since the End User of License is very limited and a good case study of how not
to write a license.  Please enquire to know more.

Recently obtained a ~130 USD [Intel NUC
NUC5CPYH](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XPVRR5M/) and it works well as
our single take [NUC video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scn2Z8wBkqs) shows.
We have recommended [[this neat PC form factor before|blog/2014/New_NUCs]] and
thankfully they are getting better and **cheaper**.
