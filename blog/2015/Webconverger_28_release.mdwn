2015 has been a busy year. An [[Android 5.0|Web_kiosk_and_signage_for_Android]]
and [[Raspberry PI2|rpi2]] port now to give customers cheaper hardware
deployment options. All this different device architectures managed
consistently via <https://config.webconverger.com/>.

The PC x86 version however is our mainstay and this is probably the last
release based on [Debian Wheezy](https://www.debian.org/releases/wheezy/). The
most exciting **new feature** is enabled with the `instantupdate` [[API]]
option which allows you to change the homepage remotely for one or many
machines in an instant. **No reboot required!** See the [instantupdate
demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJehjCZg02k). The technology behind this
is [Websockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) and the service runs upon <https://wss.webconverger.com/>.

The [detailed changelog between 27.1 and
28.0](https://github.com/webconverger/webc/compare/27.1...28.0) otherwise shows
a raft of security updates and minor bug fixes. If you are Live user, you
really must update for the [Flash fixes
alone](https://twitter.com/darkuncle/status/590240595563585536). For install
users... you should have nothing to worry about. Do double check the version on
`about:` in case something is amiss.. It's never a bad idea to re-install (it only
takes a couple of minutes)!

Coming soon: A **major update** where we wil upgrade from Debian wheezy to
[jessie](https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/) smoothly. Work in our
[testing branch](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/tree/testing) is well
underway and we hope to release the next version after Debian makes the switch.
