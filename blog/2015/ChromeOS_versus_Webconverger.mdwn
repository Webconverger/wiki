Webconverger's main competitor especially in the K12 school (assessments)
market is Google with their Google Chrome OS aka Chrome{books,box} product,
which is typically sold as a hardware and software bundle.

It's high time to post an update on a 6 year old
[[blog/entry/Comparing_Google_Chrome_OS]] blog, which demonstrated that we had
support for inexpensive [Netbook
category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbook) of PCs and speculated what
Google would do. Six years later and Google are domineering.

To summarise; the main advantages that Webconverger has over Google are:

* Simpler, less is more. Less things to understand and we provide great customer service if you get stuck!
* **No lock-in** as opposed to [Google Cloud Print](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Print), specific hardware, (App) extensions & other office related services upsell... these are all proprietary ways for Google to lock you into their solution
* We don't try to own your users, we don't ask users to login or register!

# The products are comparable

Webconverger actually started before Google did, in 2007:

* [Chrome for kiosks](https://www.google.com/work/chrome/devices/for-kiosks/index.html) like regular Webconverger
* [Chrome for signage](https://www.google.com/work/chrome/devices/for-signage/index.html#cmc-module) like [Webconverger Neon](http://neon.webconverger.com/)
* The [Chrome management console](https://www.google.com/work/chrome/management-console/index.html) is analogous to Webconverger's <https://config.webconverger.com/> and [[API]].

# Pricing

Google recently became somewhat transparent with their
[pricing](https://www.google.com/intl/en_sg/chrome/business/devices/pricing.html).
We too offer discounts, and based upon their resellers [perpetual license
page](https://shop.promevo.com/index.php/chrome-management-console/management-console-business.html)
they charge 150USD whilst [we charge
200USD](https://webconverger.com/pricing/).

ChromeOS's perpetual Licenses seem analogous to our **One off subscriptions**. Like us they
also do [annual
subscriptions](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2717664?hl=en), but
oddly limited to North America. They charge [50USD per year](https://shop.promevo.com/index.php/google-chrome-management-console-business-annual-renew.html) and [we currently charge 100USD](https://webconverger.com/pricing/).

# Hardware

The hardware is difficult to directly compare since they design their own
hardware and subsidise it accordingly. For example a Chromebook at 250USD is a
good price, though you need to remember you are effectively locked to running
Google software on that hardware, limiting your choice.

Webconverger does not design hardware. We focus on supplying software that will
run on any PC. This broadens your hardware choice and software choices too.
Have old PC stock you want to deploy Webconverger to? No problem.  What to run
in Virtualbox? No problem with Webconverger.

# Google's embrace, extend and extinguish... via extensions

One of our [system integrators](http://uniontechcoop.com/) reports why he chose Webconverger:

1. The Chrome feature to allow a user to sign in to the browser itself is
in appropriate in shared use environments but it happens all the time in
practice and users frequently forget to sign out! - Webconverger prevents
this user misbehavior completely.

2. Installing Chrome Extensions is quickly becoming a 'go to' way for
malicious actors to get malware onto endpoints even without Admin rights and
again Webconverger prevents this from becoming an issue.

3. Simply closing all tabs to get a fresh session is much faster than the
login/logout required on a fat client.
In the education environment Webconverger rocks!

One other thing to note is that malicious Chrome Extensions 'follow'
the Google user account from computer to computer. Any malicious Extensions
must be deleted in the user account itself which adds to Administrator
workload.

# What is the price of freedom?

We do currently charge a little bit more for our software. However running
unconfigured or testing one machine without configuration management is **free
of cost**. As a business supporting an opensource product, we want to attract
and invoice large deployments. Deployments where choice, privacy and
[openness](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commits/master) about the way
their clients get on the Web are important. They choose [Webconverger](https://webconverger.com/).
