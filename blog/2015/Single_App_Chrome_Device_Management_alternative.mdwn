Google have announced the
[chromebit](http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/17/google-and-asus-launch-the-85-chromebit-a-chrome-os-desktop-on-an-hdmi-stick/)
<a
href=http://googleforwork.blogspot.com.es/2015/11/reaching-customers-with-kiosks-and-digital-signage-just-got-simpler.html><abbr
title="Single App Chrome Device Management">Single App CDM</abbr> mode</a>
which Webconverger has offered for several years now via <https://config.webconverger.com/>.

Google are charging 24USD a year for the service and we typically sell the
[200USD one off](http://webconverger.com/pricing) charge. Our the 7+ years
we've offered commercial services, our customers tell us they much prefer the
one off cost. Hardware wise, currently our flagship product using the Firefox
browser is PC only. Chrome OS is generally locked to particular hardware. We
did make an effort to support the [[Raspberry Pi2|rpi2]], though has efforts
have somewhat stalled due a [Broadcom graphics
issue](http://dabase.com/blog/Webkit_on_Rpi2/).

Besides the differences outlined in [[blog/2015/ChromeOS_versus_Webconverger]],
we do not allow remote screen grabs as we think it can violet use [[privacy]].
We also cannot tell how our kiosk is used. That's upto the configured homepage
to determine how it was used.

So to summarise, we ask to consider Webconverger on PC as alternative to Google
Chrome OS on Chromebit with <abbr title="Single App Chrome Device
Management">Single App CDM</abbr>.

* [Webconverger is more transparent](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commits/master)
* Webconverger cares more about [[privacy]]
* Webconverger is not Google. We do not depend on any Google service.
* We will not upsell you any Google service
* Supporting our work, will be indirectly support work for cheaper ARM based hardware support

Please ask for us [alternative quote](https://config.webconverger.com/quote/)
where you can use your existing PC stock instead of being locked into the
Google ecosystem.
