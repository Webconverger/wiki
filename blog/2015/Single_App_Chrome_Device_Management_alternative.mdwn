Today Google have announced the
[chromebit](http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/17/google-and-asus-launch-the-85-chromebit-a-chrome-os-desktop-on-an-hdmi-stick/)
with <a
href=http://googleforwork.blogspot.com.es/2015/11/reaching-customers-with-kiosks-and-digital-signage-just-got-simpler.html><abbr
title="Single App Chrome Device Management">Single App CDM</abbr> mode</a> aka
[Chrome OS for kiosks](https://www.google.com/work/chrome/devices/for-kiosks/)
which Webconverger has offered for several years now via
<https://config.webconverger.com/>.

Google are charging 24USD a year for the service where we typically sell the
[200USD one off](https://webconverger.com/pricing) (bulk discounts available!)
charge. Over the 7+ years we've offered commercial services supplying kiosk &
signage OS software, our customers tell us they much prefer the one off cost.
Hardware wise, currently our full featured flagship product using the Firefox
browser is PC only. Chrome OS is generally locked to particular hardware. We
did make an effort to support the [[Raspberry Pi2|rpi2]], though recently
efforts have somewhat stalled due a [Broadcom graphics
issue](http://dabase.com/blog/Webkit_on_Rpi2/).

Besides the differences outlined in [[blog/2015/ChromeOS_versus_Webconverger]],
we do not allow remote screen grabs as we think it can violate user
[[privacy]].  We also cannot tell how our kiosk is used, since we do not log
the surfing session like out competitors do. We believe it is upto the
configured homepage to determine how it was used.

So to summarise, we ask you to please consider Webconverger on PC as
alternative to Google Chrome OS on Chromebit with <abbr title="Single App
Chrome Device Management">Single App CDM</abbr>.

* [Webconverger is more transparent](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commits/master)
* Webconverger cares more about [[privacy]]
* Webconverger is not Google. We do not depend on any Google service.
* We will not upsell you any Google service
* Supporting our work, will be indirectly support work for cheaper ARM based hardware support

Please ask for us [alternative kiosk
quote](https://config.webconverger.com/quote/) where you can use your existing
PC stock instead of being locked into the Google ecosystem.
