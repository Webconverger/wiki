It has been 3 months since the [[blog/entry/Webconverger_23_release]] which has
been a fine stable release. Now it's time to upgrade for Live users for
security reasons and a couple of new features mainly driven by Firefox.

# What's new?

[Detailed changes between 23.0 and 24.0](https://github.com/webconverger/webc/compare/23.0...24.0)

* [Firefox 28](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/28.0/releasenotes/)
* MP4 video playing support, so you can use an MP4 video now to [[attract patrons to your service|screensaver]] when idle
* Flash security updates
* Linux kernel 3.12
* New filter= API which complements our new (yet to be launched) [[filter.webconverger.com|filtering]] service for fine grained blacklisting (think OpenDNS, but cheaper)

For install users of 23.0, the upgrade delta is about 178M, when
[[automatically upgrading|upgrade]]. Github does throttle your connection or if
you are on a poor internet connection, upgrading can be quite a long winded
process. Do please check what version you are running by looking at `about:` or
using the WEBCVERSION homepage expansion. Paid subscribers can quickly check
the version of their machines by clicking the information icon on the [control
panel](http://www.webconverger.com/screenshots/#managed-machines-scale). If in any
doubt, please do download the [latest release](http://dl.webconverger.com/latest.so)
and re-image your machines!

Please support our work by [purchasing a

[free trials of our central management
tool](https://config.webconverger.com/trial/), so you can see for yourself how
easy it is to manage a fleet of machines accessing the Web. Thank you!
