Today we launch a new [[filtering]] service **filter.webconverger.com**. It's
an ongoing service to block any combination of ads, blasphemy, cp, dating,
file, gambling, gaming, image, malicious, pharma, piracy, porn, proxies, social
media & video categories of sites.

It competes with the [OpenDNS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDNS) service,
though at a cheaper price, typically sold as an annual subscription.

Please contact sales to get on a trial!
