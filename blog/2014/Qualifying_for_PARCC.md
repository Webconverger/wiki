The <a href="http://parcconline.org/"><abbr title="Partnership for Assessment
of Readiness for College and Careers">PARCC</abbr> initiative</a> was brought
to my attention by Matthew Newton at Montclair High School, a K12 school in NJ,
USA.

# PCs running Webconverger versus Chromebooks

The school contact raised concerns about using [Chromebooks in student
assessments](http://googleenterprise.blogspot.sg/2012/12/chromebooks-for-student-assessments-and.html).

The cost of acquiring physical Chromebooks and their [management
console](http://www.google.com.sg/intl/en/chrome/business/devices/features-management-console.html)
to lock them down for American schools is significant.

What if you could turn an existing PC temporarily into a locked down Web kiosk
for online examinations for <a href="http://www.webconverger.com/pricing/">just
10USD</a>?

Webconverger could be just the solution schools need to roll out their PARCC
testing in a timely and cost effective manner!

# Pursuing a PARCC certified solution

The Web application carrying out the <abbr title="Partnership for Assessment of
Readiness for College and Careers">PARCC</abbr> examinations is called
**TestNav** and it's implemented by
[Pearson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_PLC).

When first investigating TestNav, I was disappointed to see
[requirements](http://www.pearsononlinetesting.com/TestNav/8/requirements_testnav_8_0_4.html)
for Java and samples that used Flash. It didn't make sense, since later
[guidelines](http://parcconline.org/sites/parcc/files/TechnologyGuidelinesforPARCCAssessmentsV3.0Sept2013.pdf)
indicated that Chromebooks could run the application, and Chromebooks do not
have Java support.

I tested the new TestNav 8 <http://www.parcconline.org/computer-based-samples>
in the latest Webconverger and they work just fine!  Pearson's Qualification
Standards for TestNav 8 are not yet publicly posted.
