The <a href="http://parcconline.org/"><abbr title="Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and
Careers">PARCC</abbr> initiative</a> was brought to my attention by a K12 school in
the USA.

<abbr title="Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and
Careers">PARCC</abbr> is a system for computer-based assessments that "Approximately 1.2
million students in 14 of the PARCC states &mdash; roughly 10 percent of students in
grades 3 through 11 across the consortium &mdash; will take the field test this
spring."

The Web application carrying out the examinations is called **TestNav** and
it's implemented by [Pearson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_PLC).

When first investigating TestNav, I was disappointed to see
[requirements](http://www.pearsononlinetesting.com/TestNav/8/requirements_testnav_8_0_4.html)
for Java and samples that used Flash. It didn't make sense, since later
[guidelines](http://parcconline.org/sites/parcc/files/TechnologyGuidelinesforPARCCAssessmentsV3.0Sept2013.pdf)
indicated that Chromebooks could run the application, and Chromebooks do not
have Java support.

The good news is that recently new
<http://www.parcconline.org/computer-based-samples> were released. I tested
them in the latest Webconverger and they work just fine!

I've contacted <http://testnavqualified.com/> several times to seek
certification, though I have yet to receive a response. Pearson's own
[Qualification
Standards](http://testnavqualified.com/assets/doc/Qualification-Standards-for-Virtualization-Products.pdf)
seem out of date. More importantly their new platform is just HTML standards
compliant with [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). The need to assert Web
browser compatibility with a Web application is a bit of a misnomer.

# PCs running Webconverger versus Chromebooks

The school I've spoken to has raised concerns about using [Chromebooks in
student
assessments](http://googleenterprise.blogspot.sg/2012/12/chromebooks-for-student-assessments-and.html).

If they were to buy into the Google ecosystem, they would need to purchase at least 250 Chromebooks.

Chromebooks that are effectively locked into Chrome OS.

Chromebooks that are effectively locked into the Google ecosystem.

Chromebooks that can only be managed at additional cost by Google's [management
console](http://www.google.com.sg/intl/en/chrome/business/devices/features-management-console.html).
Our [management console](https://config.webconverger.com/) is easier to use and
does [not cost extra](http://www.webconverger.com/pricing/).

Webconverger is competitive here since:

* Webconverger runs on any (refurbished >=1G of RAM) generic PC, you don't need to buy a special notebook
* A PC can be temporarily made into a "<abbr title="Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and
Careers">PARCC</abbr> client" by booting Webconverger and associating that <a href="https://config.webconverger.com/">machine with a control panel set to the test</a>, e.g. homepage=http://epat-parcc.testnav.com/client/index.html#login?username=PARCC_35&password=PARCC_35
* Our [pricing](http://www.webconverger.com/pricing/) allows for month by month use, so it is extremely cost effective compared to buying into Google and becoming effectively trapped

So the school in question is hoping to use existing PCs with Webconverger
temporarily for the <abbr title="Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for
College and Careers">PARCC</abbr> trial in the Spring. And other [PARCC
states](http://www.parcconline.org/parcc-states) should too! Please contact us,
we are happy to provide a **PARCC technology solution**.
