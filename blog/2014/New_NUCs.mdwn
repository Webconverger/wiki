We initially blogged about the promising
[[Next_Unit_of_Computing|blog/2012/Next_Unit_of_Computing]] form factor back in
2012 by [Intel](http://intel.com/nuc) . What's changed?

# Different manufacturers offering the NUC

This should mean lower prices, with different OEMs putting together
their own competitive NUC solutions. [Anandtech reviews the NUC Gigabyte offerings](http://anandtech.com/show/7648/gigabyte-brix-pro).

They all should be plug and play with Webconverger.

# The cheapest NUC?

We've heard excellent reports of the [Intel
DN2820FYKH](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/nuc/nuc-board-dn2820fykh.html)
from customers.  They are well made and use the cheaper Celeron based
processor. These are going for **less than 200USD**!

September 2014 Update: Look out for the Atom [NUC Thin Canyon](http://nucupdate.com/sept2014/d_pub/thincanyonpb.htm) (DE3815TYKHE) and the <a href=http://nucupdate.com/sept2014/d_pub/viewdemoposter.html?pt=Intel%20NUC%20Kiosk%20eDP&psrc=Kiosk%20(eDP)&pdlink=demokiosk>Intel NUC Kiosk eDP</a>. These are around the 150USD mark and lowering.

Also do compare the **Recommended Customer Price** at the [Intel ARK](http://ark.intel.com/products/series/70406/Intel-NUC-Boards).
