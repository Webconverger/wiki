We initially blogged about the promising
[[Next_Unit_of_Computing|blog/2012/Next_Unit_of_Computing]] form factor back in
2012 by [Intel](http://intel.com/nuc) . What's changed?

# Different manufacturers offering the NUC

This should mean lower prices, with different OEMs putting together
their own competitive NUC solutions. [Anandtech reviews the NUC Gigabyte offerings](http://anandtech.com/show/7648/gigabyte-brix-pro).

They all should be plug and play with Webconverger.

# The cheapest NUC?

We've heard excellent reports of the [Intel
DN2820FYKH](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/nuc/nuc-board-dn2820fykh.html).

Well made and uses a cheaper Celeron based processor. These are going for
**less than 200USD**!
