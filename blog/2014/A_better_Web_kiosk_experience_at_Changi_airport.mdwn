Since moving to Singapore about two years ago, I've fallen in love with [Changi
Airport](https://twitter.com/FansofChangi). It's the best Airport in the world.

However it pains me to see their [Internet stations](http://www.changiairport.com/at-changi/internet-and-business-services/internet-access), with such poor support for <a href=http://whatwg.org/html>modern HTML standards</a>:

It wouldn't surprise me that these kiosk running old software had:

* Some Web sites simply wouldn't work
* Or work with much reduced functionality
* Waste peoples time without have good form validation controls
* Have a range of security issues since it's so out of date

If Changi airport would upgrade their ~550 Internet stations software to run Webconverger:

* Changi Airport would instantly go from 42 to 455 points with the <http://html5test.com/> for **far better Web experience** and happier users
* Users of the kiosks would have better Web experiences with <a href=/img/changi-privacy-click-through.jpg>privacy and safety</a> improvements - **better security** for passengers
* Kiosks running Webconverger would auto update to track the latest Firefox developments, ensuring it doesn't just stay at 455 points - **always getting better**

Webconverger is used by various US, New Zealand and UK government institutions
and several banks. There are at least [six
thousand](http://ping.webconverger.org/) machines running the Webconverger
software all around the world, software made right here in Singapore.
