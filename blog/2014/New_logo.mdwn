# Incorporating Webconverger's new icon into the browser chrome

Currently users have **no idea what kiosk software** they are using. So with
the logo embedded now a curious user can hover over the 35x35 flower icon
embedded into the top right of the `{webconverger,webcnoaddressbar}` chrome to
see the tooltip Webconverger. They cannot interact with the icon and **cannot
click away** to browser <https://webconverger.com/> for example.

Hopefully [this symbol](/img/2014/flower.svg) can give confidence to the user that the are using a secure & privacy concious Web kiosk!

The new logo is:

1. The petal symbolises a configured machine, typically deployed via USB stick (hence the petal shape)
2. The detached petal, demonstrates machines can be easily detached and reattached. i.e. moved between configurations or even to leave Webconverger services altogether, since we don't lock in customers.
3. The centre symbolises a customer configuration, e.g. https://config.webconverger.com/client/**[CUSTOMER_EMAIL]**
