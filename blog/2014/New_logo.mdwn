Back in [[2007|acknowledgements]] a daisy flower was hastily chosen as
Webconverger's logo to express simplicity. Over time it has found to be a
little too generic and probably not reflective of our "enterprise" positioning
in the PC software market. Therefore we commissioned
<http://www.hawkenking.com/> to update the logo to be a little more unique and
serious looking.

# Update rationale

The old formats of Webconverger's logo are:

<img src=/img/2014/bg-orig.png>
<img src=/img/2014/logo.png>

The new logo is:

<img src=/img/2014/logo-style1-annotation-04.png>

1. The petal symbolises a configured machine, typically deployed via USB stick, hence the shape
2. The detached petal, demonstrates machines can be easily detached and reattached. i.e. moved between configurations or even to leave Webconverger services altogether, since we actively protect customers from [vendor lock in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in)
3. The centre symbolises a customer configuration, e.g. https://config.webconverger.com/client/**[CUSTOMER_EMAIL]**

The font used is <https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/neo-sans/>.

# Incorporating Webconverger's new icon into the browser chrome

Currently users have **no idea what kiosk software** they are using. So with
the logo embedded now a curious user can hover over the 35x35 flower icon
embedded into the top right of the `{webconverger,webcnoaddressbar}` chrome to
see the tooltip _Webconverger_. They cannot interact with the icon and **cannot
click away** to browse <https://webconverger.com/> for example.

Hopefully [our new symbol](/img/2014/flower.svg) can give confidence to the user that the are using a secure & privacy concious Web kiosk!
