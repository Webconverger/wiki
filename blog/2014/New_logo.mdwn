Back in [[2007|acknowledgements]] a daisy flower was hastily chosen as
Webconverger's logo to express simplicity. Over time it has found to be a
little too generic and probably not reflective of our "enterprise" positioning
in the PC software market. Therefore we commissioned
<http://www.hawkenking.com/> to update the logo to be a little more unique and
serious looking.

# Update rationale

The old formats of Webconverger's logo are:

<img src=/img/2014/bg-orig.png>
<img src=/img/2014/logo.png>

The new logo is:

<img src=/img/2014/logo-style1-annotation-04.png>

1. The petal symbolises a configured machine, typically deployed via USB stick, hence the shape
2. The detached petal, demonstrates machines can be easily detached and reattached. i.e. moved between configurations or even to leave Webconverger services altogether, since we actively protect customers from [vendor lock in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in)
3. The centre symbolises a customer configuration, e.g. https://config.webconverger.com/client/**[CUSTOMER_EMAIL]**

The font used is <https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/neo-sans/>.

The canonical location of the new logo is: <https://webconverger.com/img/logo.svg>

# Incorporating Webconverger's new icon into the browser chrome

Currently users have **no idea what kiosk software** they are using. So with
the logo embedded now a curious user can hover over the flower icon embedded
into the top right of the `{webconverger,webcnoaddressbar}` chrome to see the
tooltip _Webconverger_. They cannot interact with the icon and **cannot click
away** to browse <https://webconverger.com/> for example.

Hopefully [our new symbol](https://webconverger.com/images/daisy.svg) can give **confidence** to the
user, that they are using a **secure & privacy concious Web kiosk**!
