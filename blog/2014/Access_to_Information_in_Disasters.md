After surviving [the boxing day Earthquake and
Tsunami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami)
[myself](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/sets/72157594221653395/), I'm acutely aware of how important information is during a disaster. Since
the Web is <strong>the</strong> information platform and Webconverger is the quickest and safest way to get onto the Web platform, I really love to see
Webconverger used in these sorts of situations to everyone's benefit.

Hence I was very proud to receive this testimonial from a [Church in New
York](http://ccrye.org/):

<blockquote style="font-size:large">
We have been using Webconverger to offer free internet access to parishioners
and visitors to our church for quite a few years, but it really came into it's
own when Hurricane Sandy hit New York in 2012! Our stone church building was
one of the only ones in the area to retain power and internet access, so it was
truly a Godsend to be able to offer hot soup and the chance to securely check
email and the news to those who weren't so lucky. We rolled out extra kiosks
using donated cpus and monitors in no time at all, and they each had queues to
use them almost around the clock. Afterwards we went back down to our usual,
single, permanent kiosk, but we keep a few old, donated computers in a cupboard
(each with a Webconverger disc) ready for the next time!

We also sponsor [Crossroads](http://crossroads.org.hk/our-sponsors):

<blockquote style="font-size:large">Thank you for supplying so many
Webconverger configurations to us.  Webconverger has been a technology that has
brought a huge difference to us and we really appreciate access to it.
</blockquote>

To save time vetting non-profits and charities we partnered with [tt-exchange
to distribute Webconverger](http://www.ctxchange.org/node/6674).

As a general rule, we are more than happy to provide a [management
console](http://config.webconverger.com/) in disaster situations. For charities
we discount or provide upto two configured machines free of cost.
