2023 update, [Webconverger rootfs](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc) is not
being actively maintained. It is not sustainable to patch the rootfs, and a
[different approach is sought](https://dabase.com/blog/2023/no-dist-upgrade/).

[Windows 10 despite some misleading articles will also reach End of support](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-sg/windows/lifecycle)

[Windows XP](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/endofsupport.aspx) and now
[Windows
7](http://www.zdnet.com/what-happens-to-windows-7-on-october-31-2014-7000033965/)
is reaching "End of Life" (EOL) on October 31, 2014. This event presents all
sorts of logistical nightmares for IT administrators around the world.

In comparison **Webconverger does **NOT** have an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-life_(product)">End of Life</a>**!

Webconverger deployments will just carry on working into the future, providing
a standard Web interface, with an up-to-date, security supported OS+browser
behind it.

We aim to support our software with updates and keep our [[API]] stable
**forever**. This is why and how we offer "Life time subscriptions" in our
[pricing table](https://webconverger.com/pricing/).

to a stable and long term supported Web platform.
