Like Windows XP before it, [Windows
7](http://www.zdnet.com/what-happens-to-windows-7-on-october-31-2014-7000033965/)
is reaching "End of Life" (EOL) on October 31, 2014. This event presents all sorts of
logistical nightmares for IT administrators around the world.

In comparison **Webconverger does **NOT** have an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-life_(product)">End of Life</a>**!

Webconverger deployments will just carry on working into the future, providing
a standard Web interface, with an up-to-date, security supported OS+browser
behind it.

We aim to support our software with updates and keep our [[API]] stable for
ever. This is why and how we offer "Life time subscriptions" in our [pricing
table](https://webconverger.com/pricing/).

Learn more about our philosophy and long term vision with our blog [Avoiding
the Microsoft upgrade
treadmill](/blog/entry/Avoiding_the_Microsoft_upgrade_treadmill/).

Please get in touch with <a
href="mailto:sales@webconverger.com?subject=Migrating from Windows">Webconverger sales</a> and we will help you migrate away from Windows
to a stable and long term supported Web platform.
