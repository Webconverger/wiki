Highlights of this 25.0 signed & tagged release, making Webconverger an even better Web kiosk:

* New super simple whitelist= [[filtering]] option
* New **numlock** [[API]], to assist deployments in banks and such for [numpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_keypad) data entry
* FF30 based Australis UI refresh, being very careful to minimise its impact on our conservative userbase
* Downsized 397Mâ†’375M, losing ~22M
* nvidia video card supported restored with the nouveau driver
* Various SSL and flash security updates

Here is the [detailed changelog](https://github.com/webconverger/webc/compare/24.0...25.0).

Would like to [[thank|acknowledgements]] my colleague [Mike
Kaply](http://mike.kaply.com/) for his fine contributions to our integrated Firefox
[webconverger addon](https://github.com/Webconverger/webconverger-addon).
