# Advantages

* Very lean root based on busybox
* Simpler and probably faster
* Firefox ESR
* Using [Webconverger's kiosk extension](http://s.natalian.org/2014-08-22/1408685569_1364x742.png) :-)
* Linux porteus-kiosk 3.12.20-porteus-kiosk #1 SMP PREEMPT Thu Jul 31 11:18:08 Local time zone must be set-- i686 GNU/Linux
* Easier to setup Wireless with their GUI

# Disadvantages

* [Central management](http://forum.porteus.org/viewtopic.php?f=102&t=3757) nowhere near as easy as <https://config.webconverger.com/>
* [Automatic updates](http://porteus-kiosk.org/automatic-updates.html) only available to paid subscribers, which I think is a bit irresponsible
* [Changelog](http://porteus-kiosk.org/changelog-automatic-updates.html) is not as detailed and integral as [Webconverger's git changelog](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commits/master)
* Firefox ESR is often quite badly out of date compared to Firefox mainline
* The install procedure isn't as slick as Webconverger. You need to setup network in advance and install it. You can use Webconverger in live mode without modifying the existing operating system
