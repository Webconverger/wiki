# Back story

A **problem** with [LiveCD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveCD)s is that they are generally speaking static distributions, on a **read only** CD.

One might assume this is good for [[security]] at first, as if there there was ever an exploit with a LiveCD, you could just reboot the machine. The exploit/virus could not write itself to the disc, so a reboot starts from a fresh uncompromising position.

This is true to an extent, however what happens if the LiveCD shipped version 1 of browser. Suppose version 1 of browser is known to be insecure. If someone is using version 1 and goes to a malicious Web site, all the account details of previous surfing in that session could be compromised. The read only LiveCD model doesn't really help there in that important security situation.

# Keeping the LiveCD up to date

## Writing to CD media

If you're using a CD in a ReWritable CD drive, then you could write updates to that disc as another CD session (not a browser session). This is all very well, but you're assuming a couple of things:

1. User has a CD writer
2. CD won't fill up
3. CD writing is a very fragile process, so nothing can go wrong!

Webconverger is not actively pursuing this option.

## Writing to USB media or hard disc

Much easier to do theoretically, though not implemented in Webconverger atm. [Debian Live](http://debian-live.alioth.debian.org/) is designed for read only environments like CDs, not USB media atm. Also USB users are the minority, so naturally CD users have been assumed.

## Updating at bootup

This is the current method, though there is a couple of serious problems:

1. If one of the servers is not responding or slow, it can disrupt the whole upgrade and boot process - very network sensitive
2. If someone is using an old version of Webconverger, there will be lots of updates and hence a lot of downloads every boot - potentially high bandwidth
3. You can't update some elements (like kernel, drivers) of a running system without a reboot. And after a reboot the updated packages will be lost of course!

## Other general problems of a apt-get dist-upgrade

As mentioned before kernel updates require a reboot, which can only work on Read Write media like USB or Hard drives.

In the case where one has a long running Webconverger system (isn't rebooted), then there might be new updated packages come available. So Webconverger needs to update itself every day or 12 hours or... you be the judge!

Updates should "just work" and not require any user intervention. However if the browser or browser extension for example is updated, the only way a user can actually update is to close his/her session and allow the browser to reload itself.

## Other thoughts

Perhaps it is best just to upgrade the browser.

Upgrade periodically with something like [cron apt](http://packages.qa.debian.org/c/cron-apt.html).

# Outlook

For CDs users, upgrades do not really work 100%. For small updates, "Updating at bootup" is fine on CD media. However as time goes on you really should [download the latest copy of Webconverger](http://download.webconverger.com/) and burn a new copy.

So for commercial (paying) customers I would suggest ordering a Webconverger CD every six months. You're free to decide whether or not to update. If you do not update, remember your fresh boot ups will be slower and your network costs will increase over time.

For the future, USB and hard drive writing methods should mature and make the upgrade process a lot smoother and cheaper.
