[[!meta title="Git powered operating system upgrades"]]

We are designing the upgrade mechanism for:

* Efficiency - We use _next level_ technology [git](http://git-scm.com/) to manage the entire root filesystem
* Help Webconverger Limited the business [to move effectively to a subscription model](http://webconverger.org/blog/entry/Webconverger_11.2_release_notes/)
* We can easily check the integrity of the filesystem, good for [[security]]
* Git is fast & efficient for upgrades, also good for [[security]]
* We can safely [downgrade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downgrade) and roll back to an earlier version
* Every [commit](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commits/master) accountable and transparent

# The upgrade features requires persistency, i.e. install to a writable medium

* USB-HDD (.img) version which can upgrade itself or do a install - [related issue](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/issues/86)
* ISO (.iso) version which can live boot and a install

## Upgrade process

Webconverger uses git to maintain the [filesystem](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc).

1. Webconverger downloads a config and looks for `fetch-revision=BRANCH`, otherwise defaults to [master](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/tree/master)
2. On boot it fetches upto that branch, unless `update-revision=SHA` is specified, which is used for mounting exact commits
3. If there is an update, the kernels upon /live/image/live are updated and a new git-revision based on the fetch branch is applied
4. On **REBOOT** the script [/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/live](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/live) in the initrd [fuse.git-fs](https://github.com/Webconverger/git-fs) mounts the git-revision SHA1 set upon the `/proc/cmdline`

17.x UPDATE: Mounting scripts move to [/lib/live/boot](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commit/184d89921a91d8af90bc507b3b46f16e6a7078c1) and `/usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks` is how they are included.

Note: After changing anything in `/usr/share/initramfs-tools/`, re-generate the initrd and commit them like so:

	update-initramfs -u -k all

In future we hope to utilise the boot-once option in extlinux, where by if the
machine failed to boot from a kernel error, a subsequent boot will revert to
the previous "known working" git-revision and kernel.

# How do I roll back / downgrade ?

This is largely for [[debugging|debug]], using `update-revision=`. Supported clients will "fast forward" out of trouble.

# No upgrades on Live version since it isn't a writable disk

If the logs say [Not a writable boot
medium](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc/live-config.sh#L312),
then you are in [Live
mode](http://config.webconverger.com/faq/#what-do-you-mean-by-live-version-and-install-version)
and you cannot upgrade until you've installed to a writable disk.

# Two reboots for an update, <48hr delay

Webconverger currently only fetches on boot, so if an update is pushed, an already
running system needs effectively **two** boots, one to fetch, and one to apply
the changes to come up on the revision.

In practice a lot of machines are shutdown overnight. So for example an update
that is pushed on a Monday afternoon, would be downloaded on the Tuesday boot
and applied on the Wednesday boot.

We want to get this time down. For example an option that syncronously checks
for new commits upon <https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commits/master>,
fetches and reboots immediately for security concious deployments.

# `noupgrade` boot API disables upgrades

Disabling upgrades will disable Webconverger from doing a `git fetch` on boot.

# Notes on validation

* using hashes as update-revision, you'll do a sort of implicit validation
* signed tags might be useful, but we'll have to have some way to circumvent that so we can push debug revisions without having to tag all of them

# Quick notes on testing before a push

1. Commit to master, make a note of sha1
* `git push origin master:test` before pushing to master, push to a remote branch [test](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commits/test)
* Append `fetch-revision=test debug` to your test instance of Webconverger
* Ensure sha1 was fetched
* Reboot and check the update was applied
* Test the update one more time
* `git push` the [[chroot]] to master to let everyone else enjoy the update
* Perhaps [tweet the change](https://twitter.com/webconverger/status/255965341203697664)
* Clean up `git push origin :test` and delete remote branch on <https://github.com/Webconverger/webc>

Note one should probably work from a branch, e.g. `git branch flashtest; git push origin flashtest -u` and then merge to master for a push

# TODOs and [issues](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/issues)

* make fetch happen periodically from /etc/inittab to reduce upgrade delay?

# Does git-fs use a lot of RAM?

Our memory requirements have gone up and by our calculations, it's about 200M of memory usage for git-fs, which isn't a lot.

# How to integrate git-fs from scratch

[/usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/git-fs](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/git-fs) ensures the git-fs binary is in the initramfs.

[/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/live-bottom/00git-fs](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/live-bottom/00git-fs) prepares the /live for mounting.

Notice <https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/tree/master/.git-fixups> which needs to run before switching.

[/lib/live/boot/overlay.sh](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/lib/live/boot/9990-overlay.sh) is where the actual git-fs mount happens.

[/etc/webc/upgrade.sh](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc/upgrade.sh)
implements the `{fetch,update}-revision=` API that fetches updates in the
background.

OPTIONAL: [mount_git](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master//etc/webc/live-config.sh#L21) function for mounting the .git/ directory for debugging.
