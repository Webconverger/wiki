# Back story

A **problem** with [LiveCD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveCD)s is that they are generally speaking static distributions, on a r**read only** CD.

One might assume this is good for [[security]] at first, as if there there was ever an exploit with a LiveCD, you could just reboot the machine. The exploit/virus could not write itself to the disc, so a reboot starts from a fresh uncompromised position.

This is true to an extent, however what happens if the LiveCD shipped version 1 of browser. Suppose version 1 of browser is known to be insecure. If someone is using version 1 and goes to a malicious Web site, all the account details of previous surfing in that session could be compromised. The read only LiveCD model doesn't really help there in that important security situation.

# Keeping the LiveCD up to date

## Writing to CD media

If you're using a CD in a ReWritable CD drive, then you could write updates to that disc as another CD session (not a browser session). This is all very well, but you're assuming a couple of things:

* User has a CD writer
* CD won't fill up
* CD writing is a fragile process

Webconverger is not actively perusing this option.

## Writing to USB media or hard disc

Much easier to do theoretically, though not implemented in Webconverger atm. [Debian Live](http://debian-live.alioth.debian.org/) is designed for read only environments like CDs, not USB media atm. Also USB users are the minority, so naturally CD users have been assumed.

## Updating at bootup

This is the current method, though there is a couple of serious problems:


* If one of the servers is not responding or slow, it can disrupt the whole upgrade and boot process - very network sensitive
* If someone is using an old version of Webconverger, there will be lots of updates and hence a lot of downloads every boot - potentially high bandwidth
* You can't update some elements (like kernel, drivers) of a running system without a reboot. And after a reboot the updated packages will be lost of course!


# Outlook

For CDs users, upgrades do not really work 100%. For small updates, "Updating at bootup" is fine on CD media. However as time goes on you really should [download the latest copy of Webconverger](http://download.webconverger.com/) and burn a new copy.

So for commercial (paying) customers I would suggest ordering a Webconverger CD every six months. You're free to decide whether or not to update. 

For the future, USB and hard drive writing methods should mature and make the upgrade process a lot smoother and cheaper.
