We are designing the upgrade mechanism for:

* Efficiency - We use _next level_ technology [git](http://git-scm.com/) to manage the entire root filesystem (this is awesome btw)
* Allow Webconverger Limited the business [to move to a subscription model](http://webconverger.org/blog/entry/Webconverger_11.2_release_notes/)

We are super sensitive about your [[privacy]], yet initially we need to collect
some more information from [daily build](http://build.webconverger.org/)
testers to **ensure this technique works**.  Ultimately we want to share our
approach here to make the "chroot on git" idea take hold amongst Linux
distributions. Therefore the hope is as a [[developer|develop]] in the near
future you can use our technology to point to your own curated chroot.

# The upgrade features requires a hard drive install

Webconverger's install makes several assumptions and uses its own lightweight
[install
script](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc/install-to-disk.sh)
to install onto a writable `/dev/sda`. This typically is the first hard drive in your PC.

WARNING: Installing Webconverger will irrevocably replace your hard drive contents.

Known issues: No wireless setup on installs, until configured (see updates.sh)

# How upgrades might work (ALPHA)

The partition has a **/.git/** directory pointing to the same **Webconverger
chroot** maintained publicly on github. Using git gives us several advantages:

* We can easily check the integrity of the filesystem, good for [[security]]
* Git is fast & efficient for upgrades, also good for [[security]]

## Fallback process

The idea is:

1. Boot from the hard disk
1. Write a flag to some magic file whenever the boot is successful, i.e. connects to $HOMEPAGE successfully or some other test
1. Updates are fetched periodically, say every hour
1. On boot, the initrd can check everything is clean and then apply the updates, `git checkout`
1. If the system does not fully boot up with the new changes, roll back to the previously working state

# [updates.sh](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc/updates.sh) and configuration

If enabled (**noupdates** is omitted) [updates.sh](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc/updates.sh) is a simple and powerful mechanism to:

* run **signed** shell code as root as the machine boots (this should not be normally needed for _Community_ uses, however it will be enabled until we are happy with the install)
* setup the machine with a [custom configuration](http://webconverger.com/buy), for paying users we plan to use the mechanism to maintain their configuration

## update logging

We are logging script output with <https://github.com/Webconverger/logs>

We will make it so that only Webconverger can see the logs atm, however to be
clear for [[privacy]], these logs will not contain any personal information.

Currently we plan to use a machine UUID and MAC to track individual machines.

# Your feedback and support is much appreciated

We believe we are doing something new and exciting in the operating system space.
Over the Web we are hoping to configure and update customers kiosk devices,
optionally offering logging and management services.

For the community we will provide an unconfigured secure stock Web kiosk with
the default homepage without the [updates.sh](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc/updates.sh) script that is reliably upto date
and publicly accountable to its chroot on github.

If we missed something please kindly let us know: <feedback2012@webconverger.com> Thank you!

Many thanks to [Anselm Garbe](http://garbe.us/) for his comments.
