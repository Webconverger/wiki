Webconverger unlike Windows for example does not require:

* a Firewall
* anti-spyware
* anti-virus

Security is complicated. It's about identifying the risks and mitigating the
risks.

Webconverger's is [[designed|design]] for [[privacy]] and [[security]], based on:

* opensource software
* no super user
* Always clears private data once a session is ended
* does not allow local data

When [[automatic_updates|upgrade]] are enabled (default):

* Debian security support
* Latest Firefox/Iceweasel browser

Some customers do not want automatic upgrades. This is not a good choice for
users as a security vulnerable Firefox will leave users ripe for phishing
attacks.
