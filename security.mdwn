[[!meta title="Webconverger has better out of the box security"]]

Webconverger unlike Windows for example does not require:

* a Firewall
* anti-spyware
* anti-malware
* anti-virus

Webconverger is [[designed|design]] for [[privacy]] and [[security]], based on:

* opensource software
* no super user
* always clears private data once a session is ended (last tab is closed or by inactivity timeout)
* does not store local data
* does not require any signup or registration
* does not snoop on users

Webconverger has [[automatic updates|upgrade]] that keep your painlessly security patched.

# Secure Tempfiles

Malware present on hacked sites has increasingly become an issue. To close one
vector of attack, we have set up Webconverger's temporary files to not be
executable by creating a new filesystem just for tempfiles and optioned with
noexec.
