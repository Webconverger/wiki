Webconverger unlike Windows for example does not require:

* a Firewall
* anti-spyware
* anti-virus

Security is complicated. It's about identifying the risks and mitigating the
risks.

Webconverger is [[designed|design]] for [[privacy]] and [[security]], based on:

* opensource software
* no super user
* Always clears private data once a session is ended
* does not allow local data

**When** [[automatic_updates|upgrade]] are enabled:

* Debian security support
* Latest Firefox/Iceweasel browser

Some customers do not want automatic upgrades. This is not a good choice for
users as a security vulnerable Firefox will leave users ripe for phishing
attacks.

# Peer review

* [Review by Andrew Patrick, Ph.D. of the Information Security Group](http://www.andrewpatrick.ca/security-and-privacy/quest-for-a-good-boot-cd-for-internet-banking/) of the [National Research Council Canada](http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/)

# Customised Webconverger

Webconverger can however be [customised](http://webconverger.com/buy/) for
[[remote_desktop_sharing|vnc]] and similar features for remote administration.
This can allow an administrator to spy on your browsing session.

# Surf with SSL to protect yourself from eavesdropping

When you surf the in most cases your browsing connection can be intercepted.
That's if the attacker can get inbetween you and your favourite Website. So who
could be in between your connection and say this site Webconverger.org?

Eavesdropping is most common with unsecured Wireless. This attack typically
occurs at the very first stage.  devil (192.168.1.1) is the wireless access
point I am using. The later points of the route (2-17) are much bigger routers
which are too busy routing huge amounts of network traffic than to isolate and
sniff yours.

To mitigate this risk use
[SSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer).  An encrypted SSL
connection is denoted by a yellow coloured URL bar. So for example instead of
visiting:

* http://gmail.com

A more secure & simple way to protect from evesdropping is to visit instead:

* https://gmail.com

Notice the difference? [https](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Https) instead of
the "clear" network messages of the much more common
[http](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http).
