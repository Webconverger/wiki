Webconverger unlike Windows for example does not require:

* a Firewall
* anti-spyware
* anti-virus

Security is complicated. It's about identifying the risks and mitigating the
risks.

Webconverger is [[designed|design]] for [[privacy]] and [[security]], based on:

* opensource software
* no super user
* Always clears private data once a session is ended
* does not allow local data

When [[automatic_updates|upgrade]] are enabled (default):

* Debian security support
* Latest Firefox/Iceweasel browser

Some customers do not want automatic upgrades. This is not a good choice for
users as a security vulnerable Firefox will leave users ripe for phishing
attacks.

# Customised Webconverger

Webconverger can however be [customised](http://webconverger.com/buy/) for
[[remote_desktop_sharing|vnc]] and similar features for remote administration.
This can allow an administrator spy on your browsing session.

# Surf with SSL to protect yourself from eavesdropping

It's important to understand the security risks of general Web browsing.  The
good scope of Web security is difficult to address in this document, however
you should know the basics.

When you surf the in most cases your browsing connection can be intercepted.
That's if the attacker can get inbetween you and your favourite Website. So who
could be in between your connection and say this site Webconverger.org?
Typically it's only the network administrator on both ends and most likely your
network administrator.

A "network administrator" is someone who can sniff packets. This is quite easy
to do with unsecured Wireless. However this is a way you can get around this
problem, and that's to use [SSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer).

An encrypted SSL connection is denoted by a yellow coloured URL bar. So for example instead of visiting:

* http://gmail.com

A more secure & simple way to protect from evesdropping is to visit instead:

* https://gmail.com

Notice the difference? [https](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Https) instead of
the "clear" network messages of the much more common
[http](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http).
