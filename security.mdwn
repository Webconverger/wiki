Webconverger unlike Windows for example does not require:

* a Firewall
* anti-spyware
* anti-malware
* anti-virus

Webconverger is [[designed|design]] for [[privacy]] and [[security]], based on:

* opensource software
* no super user
* always clears private data once a session is ended
* does not store local data (**live** read-only session by default) a.k.a. [defence in depth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_in_depth)
* does not require any signup or registration

ISO-based releases are read-only and gain additional security since a reboot
always returns the system to a known good state.

From [[blog/entry/Webconverger_15_release_notes]] Webconverger has the new
ability to stay automatically upto date and patched on installed versions. We
are working to make [[upgrades|upgrade]] apply quicker than the typical two boot
cycle it requires currently.

* Update pushed on [Wednesday](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commit/edd97ee47345e44a22a9dbf18cca48669e2694d4) morning GMT
* A machine that has booted after that push, fetches that update, for a example a machine in the states
* A subsequent reboot of that machine (assuming it's turned off at night) will apply that patch, typically Thursday PDT morning
* `about:` in the URL bar can verify which git revision that client is running

We can support Enterprise IT administrators looking to finely tune updates and test updates
before rolling them out.

# Surf with SSL to protect yourself from eavesdropping

When you surf the Web in several cases your browsing connection can be
intercepted.

That's if the attacker can get inbetween you and your favourite Website. So who
could be in between your connection and say this site Webconverger.org?

Eavesdropping is most common with unsecured Wireless. This attack typically
occurs at the very first stage on your access point.

To mitigate this risk use
[SSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer).  An encrypted SSL
connection is denoted by a yellow coloured URL bar. So for example instead of
visiting:

* <http://gmail.com>

A more secure & simple way to protect from eavesdropping is to visit instead:

* <https://gmail.com>

Notice the difference? [https](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Https) instead of
the "clear" network messages of the much more common
[http](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http).

# Secure Tempfiles

Malware present on hacked sites has increasingly become an issue. To close one
vector of attack, we have set up Webconverger's temporary files to not be
executable by creating a new filesystem just for tempfiles and optioned with
noexec.
