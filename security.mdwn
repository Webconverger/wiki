Webconverger unlike Windows for example does not require:

* a Firewall
* anti-spyware
* anti-malware
* anti-virus

Webconverger is [[designed|design]] for [[privacy]] and [[security]], based on:

* opensource software
* no super user
* always clears private data once a session is ended
* does not store local data (**live** read-only session by default) a.k.a. [defence in depth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_in_depth)
* does not require any signup or registration

ISO-based releases are read-only and gain additional security since a reboot always returns
the system to a known good state.

We are currently ( Feb-Mar 2012 ) working on an install to disk version which will require
update capability to remain secure since the system disk is writable. However, adding updates
means creating another vector of attack. We will be adopting the current best practices of
distributing only GnuPG-signed packages: each system will be able to independently verify
that we authorized the updates. An attacker would have to compromise a distribution
server, find a way to gain offline access to our GPG-keyrings, and crack the passwords.

# Surf with SSL to protect yourself from eavesdropping

When you surf the Web in several cases your browsing connection can be
intercepted.

That's if the attacker can get inbetween you and your favourite Website. So who
could be in between your connection and say this site Webconverger.org?

Eavesdropping is most common with unsecured Wireless. This attack typically
occurs at the very first stage on your access point.

To mitigate this risk use
[SSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer).  An encrypted SSL
connection is denoted by a yellow coloured URL bar. So for example instead of
visiting:

* <http://gmail.com>

A more secure & simple way to protect from eavesdropping is to visit instead:

* <https://gmail.com>

Notice the difference? [https](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Https) instead of
the "clear" network messages of the much more common
[http](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http).

# Secure Tempfiles

Malware present on hacked sites has increasingly become an issue. To close one
vector of attack, we have set up Webconverger's temporary files to not be
executable by creating a new filesystem just for tempfiles and optioned with
noexec.
