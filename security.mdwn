Security is complicated.

Webconverger's arguments for better security is that it is based on:

* opensource software
* Debian etch
* Firefox/Iceweasel
* Always clears private data once a session is ended
* no super user
* automatic updates

Webconverger unlike Windows for example does not require:

* a Firewall
* anti-spyware
* anti-virus
