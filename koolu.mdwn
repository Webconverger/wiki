A Koolu is about a 200USD device. However [robust kiosk hardware](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/1858899680/) itself is usually quite expensive as it is expected to withstand public use of the terminal. So the pros really perhaps are it's small physical footprint and silent operation.

The biggest CON atm seems to be it's [sluggish CPU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amd_geode#AMD_Geode) which falls short of [Firefox's requirements.](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/system-requirements.html)

# ACPI

`acpi=off` to boot succesfully


# Hands

Phil Hands and Luke Leighton have done some [Koolu optimised packages.](http://ftp.hands.com/hands-deb/pool/koolu/)

## Still need to try

If you want to give is a try, boot any standard Etch install media, and at
the boot prompt, type:

    auto url=hands.com classes=koolu


# Issues

* Slow CPU
* Backport WebKit GTK+?
* Supply of those little buggers
* Video drivers
* Custom kernel
