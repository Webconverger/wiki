To configure Webconverger with an attraction screensaver, for example to tell
potential users which services are on offer, you need to setup your homepage,
the homepage you control, to do that.

This guide will run through a way to do this, by playing a video file after a
period of inactivity.

This homepage should be tailored to your kiosk setup. Since you might not want
your regular visitor's from home to see this screensaver.

# How to make the videos, given JPEG slides

Using
<https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Create%20a%20video%20slideshow%20from%20images>
as a starting point.

Problem is ffmpeg will take the resolution of the first frame, then only encode
identically-sized frames. The trick is to expand the image using imagemagick's
extent function:

	tmpdir=$(mktemp -d)
	count=0
	padtowidth=3
	for p in *.jpg
	do
		convert "$p" -gravity center -background black -extent 1440x1080  $tmpdir/$(printf "%0*d\n" $padtowidth $c).jpg
		c=$(($c + 1))
	done
	echo $c images
	ffmpeg -r 1/10 -i $tmpdir/%03d.jpg -c:v libx264 -r 30 -pix_fmt yuv420p out.mp4
	rm -rf $tmpdir

The above code assumes an end resolution of **1440x1080**.

# How to make your homepage play the video after a period of inactivity

You need to introduce a modified piece of
[Javascript](https://github.com/Webconverger/Screensaver/blob/master/attract/attract.js)
and source it, configuring:

* the video file you want to play
* the period of time for the timeout

Next you need to configure Webconverger with the security policy to allow the screensaver to play fullscreen, using the prefs API pointing to a code snippet that looks like:

	Components.utils.import("resource://gre/modules/Services.jsm");
	Components.utils.import("resource://gre/modules/NetUtil.jsm");
	Services.perms.add(NetUtil.newURI("http://YOUR_HOMEPAGE_URL/"), "fullscreen", 1);
	pref("full-screen-api.allow-trusted-requests-only", false);

Remember to replace **YOUR_HOMEPAGE_URL**.

# How to update the screensaver

You should host the video file as an MP4 on your homepage URL, e.g. `$homepage/attract.mp4`

You simply update the video file on your homepage.

* See <http://attract.webconverger.com/> for a demo, REMEMBER: you need to configure Webconverger's panel with the security policy to run the video in fullscreen without prompt
