* These guys have a really great product <strong>Webconverger is the best kiosk OS</strong> out there - and we tried a LOT of them!  --John Wolf at <a href="https://www.medlabcares.com">MedlabCares</a>
* I have deployed two new Webconverger kiosks. They are simply AWESOME!  I have worked with LTSP terminals in schools, public internet stations, etc. but your solution is so well done. It is easy. It is fast and simple - obviously a very slim linux build in the background.  Kudo's for a fantastic job! -- Joe Guenther <http://oldscollege.ca/>
* ... your product is incredible.  We haven't rolled out many of our users with the CD -- but it works perfectly when we do. [Jackson from Pawpawmail.com](http://pawpawmail.com)

"If you are looking for an OPAC solution that gets rid of your old OS and menuing software (in our case, Windows XP and CARL's Everybody's Menu), keeps your old machines perfectly viable for another few years, and removes the need for antivirus and security software licensing, then Webconverger is for you!  Install everything in just minutes and move on to your other library IT projects." Tom @ <http://scarboroughlibrary.org/>

"We use Webconverger as a solution for our POS system in our convenience
stores.  Webconverger works very well from individual USB flash memories.  This
allows to identify each system user by their personal USB.  Thanks,
Webconverger !!!!" - Juan @ SISTELCOIN, S.L.
