# How Webconverger blanks

Webconverger use Xorg's default Energy saving and screen blanking features.

`xset q` reveals:

	Screen Saver:
	  prefer blanking:  yes    allow exposures:  yes
	  timeout:  600    cycle:  600


So typically Webconverger will only blank after **10 minutes**.

However some customers don't want the screen to blank at all. In these cases
customers typically also use `kioskresetstation=`.

If kioskresetstation is configured for 10 minutes or less then the screen will
not blank. I prefer this method since no new configuration options need be
introduced.
