# How Webconverger blanks

Webconverger uses Xorg's default Energy saving and screen blanking features by default.

`xset q` reveals:

	Screen Saver:
	  prefer blanking:  yes    allow exposures:  yes
	  timeout:  600    cycle:  600

So typically Webconverger will only blank after **10 minutes**. However monitor
hardware can override this.

Customers who don't want the screen to blank at all should use the boot option
`noblank` (available from version 2.45 of webconverger-base). Note without
blanking a typical (non-specialised) monitor's life span will be drastically
shortened. Of course such a feature is an absolute must if Webconverger is
acting as a [[digital_sign|kiosk]].

# Kiosk reset

`kioskresetstation` resets the Webconverger terminal after a specified number of minutes of inactivity.
