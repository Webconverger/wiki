# Mirror configuration

Current I upload new images to au / webconverger.org from my development machine.

And then I copy it to the main mirror at download.webconverger.com.

	rsync --delete -essh -artpv --progress /web/mirror.webconverger.org/ webconverger.com:download.webconverger.com

http://mirror.webconverger.org/ is intended to be the main mirror. If you would like to rsync from it too, let me know.
