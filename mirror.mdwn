# Mirror configuration

Current I upload new images to au / webconverger.org from my development machine.

And then I copy it to the main mirror at download.webconverger.com.

	rsync --delete -essh -artpv --progress /web/mirror.webconverger.org/ webconverger.com:download.webconverger.com

http://mirror.webconverger.org/ is intended to be the main mirror. If you would like to become a mirror, use something like in a cron job `contrab -e` like so:

	MAILTO="your-admin-email-address@example.com"
	@daily rsync -artpv --progress webconverger.org::mirror /web/webc-mirror.example.com

I'm keeping a lot of older copies of webc at mirror.webconverger.org currently,
so maybe you can tweak rsync to grab only the newer stuff to save space.
