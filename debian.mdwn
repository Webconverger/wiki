Webconverger is a Debian derivative.

There are many Linux distributions based on Debian. However very few contribute
back to Debian. Webconverger will contribute back to Debian, with a goal to
become a "flavour" of Debian or at least Debian Live.

# Webconverger patches in Debian

* dwm
* debian-live

# Elements of Webconverger not in Debian yet

## webconverger-base

When a sysadmin installs webconverger-base on their system, their machine would
become a locked down Web Kiosk. This may not be desirable!

So perhaps a webc user should be created. Thereby a Debian user could switch
into that user and temporarily create a Web kiosk. It's still quite a special
use case.

More specific issues:

* Init script
* Locking down X is done via a init script
* Designed more for a live system

## iceweasel-webconverger

Not incredibly useful without the persistent-browser script from **webconverger-base**

The way Firefox/Iceweasel extensions are packaged in Debian, is that if a
extension is installed it applies to all users and profiles. This may not be
desirable!

## The webc key

# Other general issues

Sometimes customers want specific patches to Debian packages. How should that be rolled out?

In the past "customised packages" have been deployed via the Webconverger
repository. Authenticate packages require a webconverger key.
