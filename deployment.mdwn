[[!meta title="Deployment options"]]

Webconverger can be deployed by a live by [[CD|iso]] or [[USB]] stick media in
about two minutes depending on the machine.

Since Webconverger is [[designed|design]] for [for just Web
applications](http://webconverger.org/ideal_just_for_web_applications).

Images are typically about 300 megabytes in size.

Webconverger aims to get _smaller_, not bigger.

Webconverger has a very minimal "setup" and uses sensible defaults and
[[features]], usually defined in a [[boot_menu|boot]].

By default a deployed Webconverger has no preferences you can set and is
designed to be "locked down" so users can't accidentally change things. This
makes Webconverger much easier to
[maintain](http://webconverger.org/maintenance/) compared to other operating
systems. It also makes Webconverger an excellent choice for **sharing** amongst
people.

* Booting a Live CD and then imaging the Webconverger ISO to the hard drive, see [[usb]]

Notice Webconverger Web applications can leverage the rich capabilities of
Firefox with HTML5 graphics and the default [[fonts]].
