Webconverger can be deployed by a live [[CD|iso]] in about two minutes depending on the
machine. This is the primary method for deployment as it is the most common
type.

Though, there are also other [deployment methods such as a [[USB]]
stick](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7737229185629530129).

Since Webconverger is [[designed|design]] for [for just Web
applications](http://webconverger.org/ideal_just_for_web_applications/).
Compressed [[mini]] images are typically about 200 megabytes in size.
Webconverger aims to get _smaller_, not bigger.

Webconverger has a very minimal "setup" and uses sensible defaults and
[[features]], usually defined in a [[boot_menu|boot]].

By default a deployed Webconverger has no preferences you can set and is
designed to be "locked down" so users can't accidentally change things. This
makes Webconverger much easier to
[maintain](http://webconverger.org/maintenance/) compared to other operating
systems. It also makes Webconverger an excellent choice for **sharing** amongst
people.

# Deployment options

Since USB boot is poorly supported by older machines, CDROM images will probably be the main deployment medium.

* [[usb]]
* [[iso]]
* netboot - currently unsupport by default, though a [customisation](http://webconverger.com/buy/) option nonetheless

From either medium, an option to install Webconverger will be given in the near
future.

Notice Webconverger Web applications can leverage the rich capabilities of
Firefox with SVG graphics and the default [[fonts]].
