# Flash

Sadly (from a purist POV), Webconverger chose to provide Flash viewer due to the fact several **compelling** Web applications employ Flash technologies.

Despite that [Flash](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/) is not free, a black hole binary blob and not supportive of [Web standards](http://www.whatwg.org/).

In an **office** or vertical market environments you probably do not require Flash & noisy multimedia.

I do defend the inclusion of Flash in the main trunk of Webconverger because I think for the most part it makes the Web more compelling.

During the [browser wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_Wars) Microsoft made the Web compelling. Thanks Microsoft. :) One has to look at the big picture sometimes. The [Web API](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html) is the **key** to unlocking the potential of Free & Open source software to the world.

# PDF

The included PDF viewer is now the proprietary [Adobe
acroread](http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/product.jsp?product=10&platform=unix).

This was chosen over the free [XPDF](http://packages.qa.debian.org/x/xpdf.html) due to xpdf's unusable printing dialog.

Though please think twice about using PDF on the Web! **HTML is the best format
to store your documents**.
