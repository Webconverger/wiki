Sadly (from a purist POV), Webconverger chose to provide Flash viewer due to the fact several **compelling** Web applications employ Flash technologies.

Despite that [Flash](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/) is not free, a black hole binary blob and not supportive of [Web standards](http://www.whatwg.org/).

In an **office** or vertical market environments you probably do not require Flash & noisy multimedia.

I do defend the inclusion of Flash in the main trunk of Webconverger because I think for the most part it makes the Web more compelling.

During the [browser wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_Wars) Microsoft
made the Web compelling. Thanks Microsoft. :) One has to look at the big
picture sometimes. The [Web
API](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html) is the **key** to
unlocking the potential of Free & Open source software to the world.

Though please think twice about using PDF on the Web! [HTML is the best format
to store your documents](http://dabase.com/blog/PDF-A_versus_HTML/).
