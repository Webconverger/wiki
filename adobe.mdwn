Despite [Flash](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/) being non free, having a
poor security track record and not supportive of [Web
standards](http://www.whatwg.org/).

## Developer notes

We download Flash updates from <http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/>.
Linux 32 bit, .tar.gz version and [commit like
so](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commit/edd97ee47345e44a22a9dbf18cca48669e2694d4).

Flash from 17.x lives in /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/

to store your documents](http://dabase.com/blog/PDF-A_versus_HTML/).
