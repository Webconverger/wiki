# [CTRL]+[p]

Webconverger only prints to auto-detected **networked printers** and **not
locally connected** printers.

Supported network printers shared through [CUPS](http://www.cups.org)
[IPP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Printing_Protocol) protocol are
automatically discovered and configured.

Holding down the [Control] and [p] keys on your keyboard gives you the printing dialog.

If you do **not see your printer in that dialog** and you just see PostScript/default (or Print to File), _your_ print server is **not correctly configured**.

# Which printer hardware?

We cannot advise on specific models, though for guidance you have two options; the easy way or the hard way.

## Easy way

Buy a printer with a **network port**. These printers are generally more
expensive and _generally_ have IPP support built in. Some do not have an IPP
print server built in so make sure you purchase it with a good exchange /
refund policy.

## Hard way

Buy any printer and attach it to a MacOSX / Ubuntu / Windows PC. Proceed to
install drivers and most importantly an IPP print server software like CUPS.
Then configure it to be shared upon the network.

On a CUPS server, important elements to enable are:

* Show printers share by other systems
* Share published printers connect to this system

These options basically set **Browsing On** and some Allow IP filters usually for your local network.

# Debugging from Webconverger

Generally it's better to [[debug]] from the print server, not the client
Webconverger.

Go to [localhost:631](http://localhost:631/) and view the **Manage printers**
tab to try and diagnose the network printer fault.

`tail -f /var/log/cups/error_log`

If you see for an example: `cupsdAuthorize: No authentication data provided.`,
that means you are restricting access. Here is an [example of printing server
which permits everything](http://static.natalian.org/2009-06-07/cupsd.conf).

# Printing to [PDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) on your network

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/3605150186/" title="CUPS-PDF by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3413/3605150186_3037f2b36f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="CUPS-PDF" /></a>

The [cups-pdf](http://packages.qa.debian.org/c/cups-pdf.html) package allows
you to setup a server on your network that basically dumps PDFs of printing
material sent to it. Hence you do not require a printer!

This is useful for debugging and allowing you to manually check what does and
does not get printed.
