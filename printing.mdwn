# [CTRL]+[p]

Printing with Webconverger either works for you or doesn't. You cannot configure anything.

Holding down the [Control] and [p] keys on your keyboard gives you the printing dialog.

If you do **not see your printer in that dialog** and you just see PostScript/default, your printer is **not correctly configured**.

# Debug

Go to [localhost:631](http://localhost:631/) and view the **Manage printers** tab to try and diagnose the printer fault.

# Recommended printers

Check for support in [this list of
printers](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters). Otherwise
since Apple Macs use [CUPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUPS), any [Mac
compatible
printer](http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_mac/mac_accessories/printers?mco=MjUzMDM4OA)
should work.

# Setting up your [CUPS printer](http://cups.org/) on your network server

You do **not** host a printer on the machine running the Webconverger operating system.

You host the printer on a server running another operating system like Ubuntu,
Debian or Archlinux. On that server, the important elements to enable in
`http://localhost:631/admin/` are:

* Show printers share by other systems
* Share published printers connect to this system

These options basically set **Browsing On** and some Allow IP filters usually for your local network.
