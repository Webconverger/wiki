# [CTRL]+[p]

Webconverger auto-detects CUPS <1.6 servers using "BrowsePoll" for CUPS
Browsing for sharing and discovery, which is [removed in CUPS 1.6](http://cups.org/newsgroups.php?s25812+gcups.general+v25830+T0).

Holding down the [Control] and [p] keys on your keyboard gives you the printing
dialog. Or you can use the `showprintbutton` [[API]] to show a print icon to
your users.

[Mozilla Firefox printing guidelines.](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-print-websites)

If you do **not see your printer in that dialog** and you just see "Print to
File", _your_ print server is **not correctly configured**. [Sorry about the Print to File, we know it is mis-leading and we are trying to remove it](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/issues/135).

So unfortunately [the user experience of just using detected printers is no longer
supported in
CUPS](http://cups.org/newsgroups.php?s25831+gcups.general+v25832+T1). You now
need to "Add printer..." up front, and hence we have introduced the `printer=`
API.

In BETA: [the printer= API](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/issues/145)

	printer=printer name,device URI,driver URI

For example a Ricoh Aficio SP 4310N with [PPD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript_Printer_Description) on IP 192.168.1.5 might be setup like so:

	printer=lab1,http://192.168.1.5/printer,http://ppd.webconverger.com/ricoh.ppd

Instead of specifying a remote [PPD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript_Printer_Description), you could use the internal (generic) drivers `lpinfo -m` [list](http://ix.io/4Mf).

For example a network printer 192.168.1.10 named "helpdesk" with dns name
printer is very likely to have "Laser printer"
[PCL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printer_Command_Language) support:

	printer=helpdesk,socket://printer,drv:///sample.drv/generpcl.ppd

However if your printer supports PostScript, you might find using the "Generic
PostScript Printer" driver `drv:///sample.drv/generic.ppd` result in better
quality prints.

# Two typical printing configurations

## Using a network printer

Buy a printer with a **network port**. These printers are generally more
expensive and _generally_ have IPP support built in. Some do not have an IPP
print server or [are simply
buggy](http://cups.org/newsgroups.php?s25812+gcups.general+v25827+T1). So make
sure you purchase it with a good exchange / refund policy.

<http://www.cups.org/documentation.php/network.html>

Discovering the "device URI" can be alarmingly difficult. As a last resort,
socket://$PRINTER_IP_ADDRESS will probably work.

## Using a CUPS server with (attached) printer shared upon it

Buy a printer and attach it to a MacOSX / Ubuntu / Windows PC. Proceed to
install drivers and most importantly the [CUPS print server
software](http://cups.org/).  Then configure it to be shared upon the network.

On a CUPS server, important elements to enable are:

* Show printers share by other systems
* Share published printers connect to this system

These options basically set **Browsing On** and some Allow IP filters usually for your local network.

If you are using a [CUPS 1.6 printer
server](http://s.natalian.org/2013-03-19/cupsd.conf), you can workaround the
lack of Browse polling by configuring your clients with a
`/etc/cups/client.conf` with a: 

	Servername Your_CUPS_server_IP

# Debugging

Generally it's better to [[debug]] from the print server, not the client
Webconverger.

`tail -f /var/log/cups/error_log`

If you see for an example: `cupsdAuthorize: No authentication data provided.`,
that means you are restricting access. Here is an [example of printing server
which permits everything](http://static.natalian.org/2009-06-07/cupsd.conf).

# Printing to a [PDF file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) to a remote machine on your network

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/3605150186/" title="CUPS-PDF by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3413/3605150186_3037f2b36f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="CUPS-PDF" /></a>

The [cups-pdf](http://packages.qa.debian.org/c/cups-pdf.html) package allows
you to setup a server on your network that basically dumps PDFs of printing
material sent to it. Hence you do not require a printer!

This is useful for debugging and allowing you to manually check what does and
does not get printed.
