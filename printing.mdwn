# [CTRL]+[p]

Printing with Webconverger either works for you or doesn't. You cannot configure anything. Network printers available through the [Internet Printing Protocol (IPP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Printing_Protocol) (used by [CUPS](http://www.cups.org) and printers connected locally with USB are automatically discovered and configured. No other printers (connected locally or served by a Windows server) will be available.

Holding down the [Control] and [p] keys on your keyboard gives you the printing dialog.

If you do **not see your printer in that dialog** and you just see PostScript/default, your printer is not using IPP or USB or **not correctly configured**.

# Debug

Go to [localhost:631](http://localhost:631/) and view the **Manage printers** tab to try and diagnose the printer fault.

`tail -f /var/log/cups/error_log`

If you see for an example: `cupsdAuthorize: No authentication data provided.`,
that means you are restricting access. Here is an [example of printing server
which permits everything](http://static.natalian.org/2009-06-07/cupsd.conf).

# Printing to [PDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) on your network

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/3605150186/" title="CUPS-PDF by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3413/3605150186_3037f2b36f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="CUPS-PDF" /></a>

The [cups-pdf](http://packages.qa.debian.org/c/cups-pdf.html) package allows
you to setup a server (Debian lenny recommended for this task) on your network
that basically dumps PDFs of printing material sent to it. Hence you do not
require a printer!

This is useful for debugging and allowing you to manually check what does and
does not get printed.

# Recommended printers

Check for support in [this list of
printers](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters). Otherwise
since Apple Macs use [CUPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUPS), any [Mac
compatible
printer](http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_mac/mac_accessories/printers?mco=MjUzMDM4OA)
should work.

# Setting up your [CUPS printer](http://cups.org/) on your network server

You do **not** host a printer service on the machine running the Webconverger
operating system.

You host the printer on a server running another operating system like Ubuntu,
Debian or Archlinux. On that server, the important elements to enable in
`http://localhost:631/admin/` are:

* Show printers share by other systems
* Share published printers connect to this system

These options basically set **Browsing On** and some Allow IP filters usually for your local network.
