# [CTRL]+[p]

Webconverger auto-detects CUPS <1.6 servers using "BrowsePoll" for CUPS
Browsing for sharing and discover, which is deprecated in CUPS 1.6.

Holding down the [Control] and [p] keys on your keyboard gives you the printing
dialog. Or you can use the `showprintbutton` [[API]] to show a print icon to
your users.

If you do **not see your printer in that dialog** and you just see "Print to
File", _your_ print server is **not correctly configured**.

Coming soon: [the printer= API](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/issues/145)

# Using a network printer

Buy a printer with a **network port**. These printers are generally more
expensive and _generally_ have IPP support built in. Some do not have an IPP
print server built in so make sure you purchase it with a good exchange /
refund policy.

Discovering the "device URI" can be alarmingly difficult. As a last resort,
socket://$IP_ADDRESS should work.

# Using a CUPS server with (attached) printer shared upon it

Buy any printer and attach it to a MacOSX / Ubuntu / Windows PC. Proceed to
install drivers and most importantly an the [CUPS print server
software](http://cups.org/).  Then configure it to be shared upon the network.

On a CUPS server, important elements to enable are:

* Show printers share by other systems
* Share published printers connect to this system

These options basically set **Browsing On** and some Allow IP filters usually for your local network.

# Debugging from Webconverger

Generally it's better to [[debug]] from the print server, not the client
Webconverger.

`tail -f /var/log/cups/error_log`

If you see for an example: `cupsdAuthorize: No authentication data provided.`,
that means you are restricting access. Here is an [example of printing server
which permits everything](http://static.natalian.org/2009-06-07/cupsd.conf).

# Printing to a [PDF file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) on your network

The [cups-pdf](http://packages.qa.debian.org/c/cups-pdf.html) package allows
you to setup a server on your network that basically dumps PDFs of printing
material sent to it. Hence you do not require a printer!

This is useful for debugging and allowing you to manually check what does and
does not get printed.
