It is configured as a 32bit Debian "squeeze" system. It replaces an older machine at 88.198.3.35.

There are two other machines that are used by Webconverger Limited:

Hetty (88.198.64.227) is rented for the following functions:

* Performing [builds](http://build.webconverger.org/)
* Storage & backup (webc only has 20G!)
* Providing a European mirror - [Webconverger.org mirror](http://download.webconverger.org/)

## Bootloader

From a hetzner installed etch and upgrading to lenny, lilo is claimed to be
installed via debconf. Though in fact **grub** is used if you use the
[KVM](http://lara01.rz3.hetzner.de/auth.asp).
