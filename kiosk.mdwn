### Goal

A quality free Firefox/Iceweasel kiosk extension for Debian

## Implementation

I have forked rkiosk and created my own extension, webconverger. I had to do this as I had to modify some of upstream's packaging and functions and upstream is a little un-cooperative. 


* `apt-get source iceweasel-webconverger` from the [Webconverger Debian package repo](http://webconverger.com/debian/)

### Fudge

Atm [includes are manually inserted into Webconverger](http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/debian-live/configs/webconverger/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/iceweasel/?rev=0&sc=0) as I have not quite understood how to put them into the webconverger extension. :/

## Help


Extension hackers wanted. Also see [[Develop]].
