[[!meta title="Webconverger chrome UI options"]]

Since Webconverger 11 you can **trial** these options from the [[boot]]
command line. **webcchrome=** options aren't quite as polished as the
individual extension/packages.

# iceweasel-webconverger

**Default** and most common. The XPI is available at
<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webconverger/> however it
doesn't quite preserve your privacy as running it ontop of the Webconverger
operating system.

# iceweasel-webcnoaddressbar

Customization option. For customers who want patrons to browse, but not enter
in URLs.

[[boot]] option `webcchrome=noaddress`

# iceweasel-webcfullscreen

Customization option. For customers who want to do [Digital
signage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signage) or just [show off some
pictures](http://www.subitophoto.net/slideshow/machupicchu/) somewhere.

If you're concerned about the scroll bar, alter the **overflow** CSS element.

[[boot]] option `webcchrome=fullscreen`

## Implementation

We have forked rkiosk and created our own extension, (iceweasel-)webconverger.
We had to do this as I had to modify some of upstream's packaging and
functions.  Upstream was also a little un-cooperative.
