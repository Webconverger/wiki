[[!meta title="Webconverger chrome UI options"]]

Webconverger has its own [Firefox kiosk
extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webconverger) to
tweak the **user interface** elements such as the URL bar and icons.

# Default

	chrome=webconverger

The goal with this default to have a **stable**, simple & familiar user
interface for using the Web.

# No address bar

	chrome=webcnoaddressbar

Customization option, perfect for [[filtered|filtering]] setups. For customers
who want patrons to browse, but not enter in URLs to navigate away.

# Fullscreen

	chrome=webcfullscreen

Customization option. For customers who want to do basic [Digital
signage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signage) or just [show off some
pictures](http://www.subitophoto.net/slideshow/machupicchu/) somewhere.

[Neon](http://neon.webconverger.com/) has further tweaks and currently
proprietary extension for the digital signage use case.

If you're concerned about the scroll bar, alter the **overflow** CSS element.
