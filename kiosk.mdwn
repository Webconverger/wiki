Extension(s) that meet the requirements of Webconverger customers. Currently there are three scenarios.


# iceweasel-webconverger

Default and most common.

## Test the extension on your Firefox 2.x browser

[http://webconverger.com/webc.xpi](http://webconverger.com/webc.xpi)

This will lock does the browser and you'll need to use the `firefox
--safe-mode` to remove it.

The best way of installing and removing this extension is with:

    deb http://webconverger.com/debian/ stable/
    deb-src http://webconverger.com/debian/ stable/

in your /etc/apt/sources.list and the `apt-get install iceweasel-webconverger` on Debian machine.

### How the .xpi was created

* apt-get source iceweasel-webconverger; cd iceweasel-webconverger-6
* zip -r webc.xpi chrome.manifest content install.rdf defaults
* `AddType application/x-xpinstall .xpi` in .htaccess

## Current issues

Restart icon should be removed in favour of a more intuitive method of closing
the browser is closing the last tab. However the default behaviour of Firefox
is create a tab when closing the last tab.

"gBrowser.tabContainer.childNodes.length" is never less than two.

# iceweasel-webcnoaddressbar

Customization option. For customers who want patrons to browse, but not enter in URLs.

# iceweasel-webcfullscreen

Customization option. For customers who want to do [Digital signage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signage) or just [show off some pictures](http://www.subitophoto.net/slideshow/machupicchu/) somewhere.


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/903110103/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1351/903110103_3b82387709_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="iceweasel-webcfullscreen" /></a>

If you're concerned about the scroll bar, alter the **overflow** CSS element. Here is an [example of a Web application providing a digital sign](http://alephitv.com/webconverger.html).

## Implementation

I have forked rkiosk and created my own extension, webconverger. I had to do this as I had to modify some of upstream's packaging and functions and upstream is a little un-cooperative. 


* `apt-get source iceweasel-webconverger` from the [Webconverger Debian package repo](http://webconverger.com/debian/)


## Slideware

"iceweasel-fullerscreen" is the name of the package of Daniel Glazman's [FullerScreen](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4650) extension. It is good particularly for slideshows, though not digital signage as 'FullerScreen' does not allow [[Flash|adobe]] movies to go fullscreen.
