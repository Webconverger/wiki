# 999 bug (without manually fixing this, X will not start)

	sudo vim /usr/bin/lh_chroot_hacks

And comment out the 999 part. :)

I've contacted [Debian Live about this 999 issue](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/debian-live-devel/2008-June/003863.html). It turns out it's for a [work around](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=433076).

# Xorg Zapping (ctrl+alt+backspace) wrongly enabled with new webc-base

The (new) [Webconverger Xorg configuration](http://git.webconverger.org/?p=webconverger-base.git;a=blob;f=etc/X11/xorg.webc.conf) is currently being overwritten. Despite a further [hook](http://git.debian.org/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=blob;f=mini/config/chroot_local-hooks/xorg). :/

# ALSA sound detection

Does not seem to be working. Need to debug/test.
