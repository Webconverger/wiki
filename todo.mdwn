Webconverger at its core is an opensource project reliant on
[[your_contributions|acknowledgements]] to strengthen the most competitive open
platform... the Web!

* Allow USB mounts so people can upload pictures to Flickr (use case by Phil Waring) - drop in udev rule
* do some sort of device API for attraction (screensaver advertisement) loop, perhaps it can be done with kioskresetstation? No, [this can be done with a Web application](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/656f92ff84582535) -- write this up!
* device API for USB coin slot / payment proxy?
* Close tab "X" should be in the tab itself. 
* Make a cooler portal
* have a service to buy CDs? or USB keys? Many people seem to have problems imaging Webconverger on [[usb]] from Windows.
* Look into advertising on the free version
* Virtual (on screen) keyboard [[blog/entry/Virtual_touch_screen_keyboard_for_Kiosks]]
* A way of entering commands on boot [like to control specific hardware](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/e8a36eccc4c78a56?hl=en) (hdparm, xrandr) -- drop things into rc2.d or somehow modulise <http://git.webconverger.org/?p=webconverger-base;a=blob;f=debian/webconverger.init;> with `webc.d/` or some other construct?
* Initial spelling language priority [[issue|blog/entry/Webconverger_4.7_release_notes]] bug
* Showcase Webconverger as a vehicle for online examinations
* CJK scripts not working (network is not setup in time, sometimes)
* Ability to change chrome [[kiosk]] options on [[boot]] (webcnoaddressbar, webcfullscreen) - [ref](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/c6c8649feadbb8dc)
* Can the home button be fixed for supporting two urls?
* nolocales by default ?
* [session timer](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/39a3dcda1305a036) ?
* integrate MACID changes
* look into search bar & favicons not loading
* fix [pinger](http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=blob;f=webconverger/config/includes.chroot/etc/network/if-up.d/ping;) since interfaces are often not eth0

# [[Extension|kiosk]] improvements needed
