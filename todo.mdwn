# Bugs, todo and ideas

These really should be prioritized and plotted onto a timeline.

* Allow USB mounts so people can upload pictures to Flickr (use case by Phil Waring)
* do some sort of device API for attraction (screensaver advertisement) loop, perhaps it can be done with kioskresetstation? No, [this can be done with a Web application](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/656f92ff84582535)
* device API for USB coin slot
* somehow showcase Firefox 3 features like SVG, rounded corners, canvas, video etc. on the portal
* have a service to buy CDs? or USB keys? Many people seem to have problems imaging Webconverger on [[usb]] from Windows.
* fix [preseed](http://git.debian.org/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=blob;f=webconverger/config/binary_debian-installer/preseed.cfg;) to choose guided by default (forget LVM+crypto)
* Ensure home is mounted encrypted and keys are thrown away between sessions in persistent-browser script (i.e. same as an encrypted swap drive), or just use shred?
* Install from [[wireless]] -- really necessary?
* Look into advertising on the free version
* Virtual (on screen) keyboard [[blog/entry/Virtual_touch_screen_keyboard_for_Kiosks]]
* A way of entering [commands like to control specific hardware](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/e8a36eccc4c78a56?hl=en)
* Focus on the hard drive installed Webconverger and making the boot options and init stuff work correctly
* Initial spelling language priority [[issue|blog/entry/Webconverger_4.7_release_notes]] bug
* showcase Webconverger as a vehicle for online examinations
* section on "automatic updates"
* fix download [[kiosk_extension|kiosk]], not to download
* prepare for 3.5 -- take advantage of **privateBrowsingEnabled** (security in layers)

# Make Webconverger smaller by installing certain packages when needed

For example in Japan and Korea Internet connections are very fast. So on boot
with `locale=ja_JP.UTF-8` the Live version could immediately just install from
the [Debian content delivery network](http://cdn.debian.net/debian/) the
following packages required for input:

	iceweasel-l10n-ja
	ttf-vlgothic
	scim-anthy scim-uim scim-skk scim-prime scim-canna scim-tables-ja

This needs to be scripted in [live-initscripts](http://git.debian.net/?p=debian-live/live-initscripts.git). [Follow up on debian-live](http://lists.debian.org/debian-live/2009/04/msg00151.html)
