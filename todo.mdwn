# Bugs, todo and ideas

These really should be prioritized and plotted onto a timeline.

Webconverger at its core is an opensource project reliant on your contributions
to strengthen the most competitive open platform... the Web!

* Allow USB mounts so people can upload pictures to Flickr (use case by Phil Waring)
* do some sort of device API for attraction (screensaver advertisement) loop, perhaps it can be done with kioskresetstation? No, [this can be done with a Web application](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/656f92ff84582535) -- write this up!
* device API for USB coin slot
* somehow showcase Firefox 3 features like SVG, rounded corners, canvas, video etc. on the portal (beware of processor intensive stuff).
* have a service to buy CDs? or USB keys? Many people seem to have problems imaging Webconverger on [[usb]] from Windows.
* fix [preseed](http://git.debian.org/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=blob;f=webconverger/config/binary_debian-installer/preseed.cfg;) to choose guided by default (forget LVM+crypto)
* Ensure home is mounted encrypted and keys are thrown away between sessions in persistent-browser script (i.e. same as an encrypted swap drive), or just use shred?
* Install from [[wireless]] -- really necessary?
* Look into advertising on the free version
* Virtual (on screen) keyboard [[blog/entry/Virtual_touch_screen_keyboard_for_Kiosks]]
* A way of entering [commands like to control specific hardware](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/e8a36eccc4c78a56?hl=en)
* Initial spelling language priority [[issue|blog/entry/Webconverger_4.7_release_notes]] bug
* showcase Webconverger as a vehicle for online examinations
* section on [automatic updates](http://git.debian.org/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=blob;f=webconverger/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/network/if-up.d/apt-upgrade;)
* fix download [[kiosk_extension|kiosk]], not to download
* prepare for 3.5 -- take advantage of **privateBrowsingEnabled** (security in layers)
* Enable find in IceWeasel.
* Set UA string --- can't really do this thanks to crazy Web apps like hotmail depending on a generic UA string
* Move or explain live.webconverger.com

Please help by [[testing]] or [[building|develop]] and submitting to patches to the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/topics).
