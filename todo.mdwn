* wpasupplicant interface (use [nostromo](http://git.debian.org/?p=users/kai-guest/nostromo) and cgi for this?)
* integrate [nostromo](http://git.debian.org/?p=users/kai-guest/nostromo) (httpd)
* Allow USB mounts so people can upload pictures to Flickr (use case by Phil Waring)
* fix [[upgrade]] (esp. on new hard drive installer images)
* do some sort of device API for attraction (screensaver advertisement) loop
* device API for USB coin slot
* somehow showcase Firefox 3 features like SVG etc. on the portal
* remove the redundant SSL warning and look into fixing the SSL mozilla mess
* Figure out mozplugger pdf issue on http://tinyurl.com/6npvk5
* Look into crosses on the tab instead of the far right
* improve download page to make downloading the latest mini for example **extremely** simple
* have a service to send CDs?
* fix preseed to choose guided by default (forget LVM+crypto)
* look into webc-yourlibrary **new window** homepage breaking bug (use iceweasel-webcnoaddressbar instead?)
* fix [xvideomode](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=499304) [forcing video modes](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/debian-live-devel/2008-August/004103.html)
* Disable boot options
* ensure home is mounted encrypted and keys are thrown away between sessions in persistent-browser script
* live installer is currently broken on the [daily builds](http://build.webconverger.org)

# Proposal

Install httpd with CGI scripts to:

	http://localhost/shutdown
	http://localhost/upgrade
	http://localhost/version
	http://localhost/wifi
	http://localhost/volume (up,down,mute)
	http://localhost/install-msttcorefonts

# [[boot]] options that needed to be hacked into webconverger-base from live-initramfs

* nosudo
* locale
* keyb
* toram
