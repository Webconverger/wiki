# Bugs, todo and ideas

These really should be prioritized and plotted onto a timeline.

* Allow USB mounts so people can upload pictures to Flickr (use case by Phil Waring)
* do some sort of device API for attraction (screensaver advertisement) loop, perhaps it can be done with kioskresetstation? No, [this can be done with a Web application](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/656f92ff84582535)
* device API for USB coin slot
* somehow showcase Firefox 3 features like SVG, rounded corners, canvas, video etc. on the portal
* Figure out mozplugger pdf issue on http://tinyurl.com/6npvk5
* Look into crosses on the tab instead of the far right
* improve download page to make downloading the latest mini for example **extremely** simple (a printable PDF guide too!)
* have a service to send CDs? or USB keys?
* fix preseed to choose guided by default (forget LVM+crypto)
* Ensure home is mounted encrypted and keys are thrown away between sessions in persistent-browser script (i.e. same as an encrypted swap drive), or just use shred?
* Install from wireless -- really neccessary?
* Look into advertising on the free version
* Virtual (on screen) keyboard [[blog/entry/Virtual_touch_screen_keyboard_for_Kiosks]]
* [security kiosk bugs](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/60d62ae72fcff707) - file:/// must go (password on cmdline)
* A way of entering [commands like to control specific hardware](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/e8a36eccc4c78a56?hl=en)
* Remove [[wireless]] default to join any open network, currently a fallback. _IN DAILY_
* [installs from USB seem broken](http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/3288149567/)
* [disable right click](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=264372). _IN DAILY_
* Figure out with the [[wireless]] networking [ipw drivers are not found](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/fb3a1861471988a8)
* [Fix UA string for Hotmail](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/fc8171407b40a733) _IN DAILY_
* Focus on the hard drive installed Webconverger and making the boot options and init stuff work correctly

# On [[kiosk]] iceweasel-webcnoaddressbar

These keys must be disabled:

* Alt+D  opens a field to enter another URL
* CTRL+J goes to Google
* CTRL+T new Tab
* CTRL+K goes to Google

# [[boot]] options that needed to be hacked into webconverger-base from live-initramfs

* keyb
* toram is this really appropriate for installs?
* locale - double check locale works - need httpd nostromo service
* **proxy** does not work from hard drive install!

# Make Webconverger smaller by installing certain packages when needed

For example in Japan and Korea Internet connections are very fast. So on boot
with `locale=ja_JP.UTF-8` the Live version could immediately just install from
the local mirror ftp.jp.debian.org/debian the following packages required for
input:

	iceweasel-l10n-ja
	ttf-vlgothic
	scim-anthy scim-uim scim-skk scim-prime scim-canna scim-tables-ja
