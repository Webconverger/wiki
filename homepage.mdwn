# Webconverger 2.30 CD versions and above

From version 2.30, [CD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_disc) ISOs have GRUB boot loaders. This allows you to modify the boot parameter line!

# USB and customised versions

These versions of Webconverger have the homepage fixed on [http://portal.webconverger.com/](http://portal.webconverger.com/) or the URL of your choice if you [paid for customisation](http://webconverger.com/buy).

If you want to set your own Website, either [[build_Webconverger_yourself|develop]] or utilise the [Webconverger customization service](http://webconverger.com/buy).
