# Embedded hardare

Most of todays embedded boards are based on [AMD Geode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Geode) LX platform. Some of the [mini
PCs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Linux_mini_computers) are:

* [Linutop](http://www.linutop.com/)
* [Koolu](http://www.koolu.com/)


## Pros

* Silent
* Small physical footprint
* Robust
* Low energy consumption


## Cons

* Long order times
* `acpi=off` to boot successfully
* Needs some patches with the video drivers
* No [[networking]]
* You need to arrange the monitor, keyboard and mouse for the device
* [Sluggish CPU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amd_geode#AMD_Geode)

# Cost

You don't need a hard drive for Webconverger.

Koolu thin client: 179EUR (+30EUR shipping) from _info AT koolu.nl_ including vat
compared to the [Linutop's
280EUR](http://www.linutop.com/shop/product_info.php?products_id=28)

# Hands on

Phil Hands and Luke Leighton have done some [Koolu optimised packages.](http://ftp.hands.com/hands-deb/pool/koolu/)

## Hard drive installation

If you want to give is a try, boot any standard Debian Etch install media, and at
the boot prompt, type:

    auto url=hands.com classes=koolu acpi=off

It's not Webconverger, though it's quite close! From here you should add the Webconverger `/etc/apt/sources.list` line:

    deb http://webconverger.com/debian/ stable/

And be able to install [[extensions|kiosk]] like iceweasel-webconverger. Good luck.
