[[!meta title="Configuring the Webconverger background wallpaper"]]

**Boot artwork** is **not** customisable. Ideally users should never see Webconverger boot.

The background image on a white background (black for neon) seen between
browser restarts can be customised by:

	bgurl=https://webconverger.com/img/logo.png

Currently the background image URL is checked after every browser session, here is the relevant code and search for "bgurl": <https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/home/webc/webc.sh>

The Webconverger brand mark can be turned off with `nobrand` in your [configuration](https://config.webconverger.com/).

Please see <http://webconverger.org/blog/2014/New_logo/> for more information on the logo.
