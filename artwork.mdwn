# usplash boot screen (hard)

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/845129169/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1309/845129169_7b43022006_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Webconverger's 2.26 new bootup screen" /></a>

apt-get source usplash-theme-webconverger from deb-src http://webconverger.com/debian/ stable/

    monty:/tmp/usplash-theme-webconverger-0.29% ls *.svg
    osdesktop-artwork.svg  throbber_back_16.svg  throbber_back.svg  throbber_fore_16.svg  throbber_fore.svg

Use [inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/) to edit the Vector graphics images, osdesktop-artwork.svg being the main piece.

A command like:

`inkscape --export-area-canvas -w 1024 -h 768 --export-png /tmp/tmp.png osdesktop-artwork.svg`

Is good to for initial testing. Usplash and its themes are actually quite complicated. If you read osdesktop-artwork.c you'll notice mention of the colour palettes and the way the progress bar is configured. I have not quite understand how to manipulate these values myself.

# The X windows centered background image on a white background (easy)

This is retrieved from $HOMEPAGE/bg.png

So the default HOMEPAGE=http://portal.webconverger.com/

So [view the current background](http://portal.webconverger.com/bg.png).

Users see this as Webconverger loads the Web browser. So initially at bootup and between sessions. The amount of time this background is viewable depends on the speed of the computer. I.e. how long it takes to load the browser.


## Thoughts

The background could be a nice image or piece of art. 

If using Flickr choose a [BY: licensed image](http://flickr.com/creativecommons/by-2.0/).


# A call for help

As you may or not notice, I could do with some help with the artwork. Any contributions would be fantastic! :)
