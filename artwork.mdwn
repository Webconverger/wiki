There are a couple of pieces of artwork in Webconverger.

1. The syslinux splash screen
2. The usplash boot screen
3. The X windows stretched background image
4. CD artwork
5. Web artwork

# 1&2 

Must be a simple 16 color-ish 640x480 ''tiled style image'' as it is difficult center/align and during the usplash stage the [image will have a square box in it showing bootup progress](http://webconverger.com/screenshots/2.1/thumb.bootup-webconverger.png). A good example image of what I am looking for is [http://flickr.com/photos/dgodin/265054078/](http://flickr.com/photos/dgodin/265054078/)

# 3 

This can be just about anything. I've kept with the **daisy theme** and chosen [http://flickr.com/photos/stevefe/13394735/](http://flickr.com/photos/stevefe/13394735/)
We've then added the **Loading...** lettering to let users know that the Web browser is loading.

Once the browser is loaded, 3 can't be seen anymore until the user closes the session.
