There are a couple of pieces of artwork in Webconverger itself

1. The usplash boot screen
2. The X windows centered background image on a white background

# usplash

apt-get source usplash-theme-webconverger from deb-src http://webconverger.com/debian/ stable/

    monty:/tmp/usplash-theme-webconverger-0.29% ls *.svg
    osdesktop-artwork.svg  throbber_back_16.svg  throbber_back.svg  throbber_fore_16.svg  throbber_fore.svg

Use [inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/) to edit the images and a command like:

`inkscape --export-area-canvas -w 1024 -h 768 --export-png /tmp/tmp.png osdesktop-artwork.svg`

To test output.

# background

This is retrieved from $HOMEPAGE/bg.png

So the default HOMEPAGE=http://portal.webconverger.com/

So [view the current background](http://portal.webconverger.com/bg.png).

Users see this as Webconverger loads Iceweasel. So initially at bootup and between sessions. The amount of time this background is viewable depends on the speed of the computer. I.e. how long it takes to load the browser.


# Thoughts

The background could be a nice image or piece of art.
