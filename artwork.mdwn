For Webconverger customization customers, customising the X background is
normal and best practice. If customers want splashy customised, this is
currently a **lot of extra work** and I have to charge accordingly.

# splashy

New and somewhat easier than usplash. There is some rough edges with the secondary screen.

Wrote up a little [customisation guide over at the d-l
wiki](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive/Howto/Custom_Artwork).

Try out the USB images on the [[mini]] [download
page](http://download.webconverger.com/mini/).  Splashy uses
[directfb](http://directfb.org/).

Image should be about 640x480 and not have any detail close to the edges.

From 2.30 `noxbg` makes the X bootup screen blank.

Image should be about 800x600 & if it is a Webconverger image it should link:

* webconverger.com/buy
* support email address

Users see this as Webconverger loads the Web browser. So initially at bootup
and between sessions. The amount of time this background is viewable depends on
the speed of the computer. I.e. how long it takes to load the browser.

### Example

So the default HOMEPAGE=http://portal.webconverger.com/
So [view the current background](http://portal.webconverger.com/bg.png).

## Thoughts

The background could be a nice image or piece of art.

# Grub & Syslinux

For the
[grub](http://flickr.com/search/?q=grub%20webconverger&w=16105436%40N00)
bootloader a 640x400 image (14 indexed colours) is required. The [Debian Live
Artwork](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive/Howto/Custom_Artwork) page has
details of how the artwork is converted.
