<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/845129169/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1309/845129169_7b43022006_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Webconverger's 2.26 new bootup screen" /></a>

apt-get source usplash-theme-webconverger from deb-src http://webconverger.com/debian/ stable/

    monty:/tmp/usplash-theme-webconverger-0.29% ls *.svg
    osdesktop-artwork.svg  throbber_back_16.svg  throbber_back.svg  throbber_fore_16.svg  throbber_fore.svg

Use [inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/) to edit the images and a command like:

`inkscape --export-area-canvas -w 1024 -h 768 --export-png /tmp/tmp.png osdesktop-artwork.svg`

To test output.

# The X windows centered background image on a white background

This is retrieved from $HOMEPAGE/bg.png

So the default HOMEPAGE=http://portal.webconverger.com/

So [view the current background](http://portal.webconverger.com/bg.png).

Users see this as Webconverger loads Iceweasel. So initially at bootup and between sessions. The amount of time this background is viewable depends on the speed of the computer. I.e. how long it takes to load the browser.


## Thoughts

The background could be a nice image or piece of art. 

If using Flickr choose a [BY: licensed image](http://flickr.com/creativecommons/by-2.0/).


# A call for help

As you may or not notice, I could do with some help with the artwork. Any contributions would be fantstic.
