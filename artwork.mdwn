[[!meta title="Configuring the Webconverger background wallpaper"]]

**Boot artwork** (the yellow tricolour progress bar) is **not** customisable.

From Webconverger 12 the background image on a white background seen between
browser restarts can be customised by:

1. Passing for example `bgurl=http://www.webconverger.com/img/logo.png` at the syslinux boot menu
2. By specifying your background image URL in the customisation form and purchasing a subscription

Using option 2 is the most convenient, as this ensures you have you background set every boot.


Currently the background image URL is checked after every browser session, here is the relevant code and search for "bgurl":
