# The X windows centered background image on a white background

`noxbg` [[boot]] option makes the X bootup screen blank.

Otherwise the background logo is retrieved from $HOMEPAGE/bg.png

Users see the artwork set in the the X background when the Web browser is reset
and re-initialising. Not when Webconverger boots the ISO image. In practice
users should not see Webconverger boot from cold start.

Therefore the artwork can only be seen between sessions. The amount of time
this background is viewable depends on the speed of the computer. I.e. how long
it takes to load the browser.

### Example

So the default HOMEPAGE=http://portal.webconverger.com/
So [view the current background](http://portal.webconverger.com/bg.png).
