**Boot artwork** is **not** customisable.

From Webconverger 12 the background image on a white background seen between
browser restarts can be customised by:

1. Passing for example `bgurl=http://hendry.iki.fi/bg.png` at the syslinux boot menu
2. By specifying your background image URL in the customisation form and purchasing a subscription

Using option 2 is the most convenient, as this ensures you have you background set every boot.


Currently the background image URL is checked after every browser session, here is the relevant code:
