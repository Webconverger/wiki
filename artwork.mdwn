# splashy (the bootup logo)

Can you change the bootup logo? Short answer: **No**, not easily

# The X windows centered background image on a white background

`noxbg` [[boot]] option makes the X bootup screen blank.

Otherwise the background logo is retrieved from $HOMEPAGE/bg.png

Users see this as Webconverger loads the Web browser. So initially at bootup
and between sessions. The amount of time this background is viewable depends on
the speed of the computer. I.e. how long it takes to load the browser.

### Example

So the default HOMEPAGE=http://portal.webconverger.com/
So [view the current background](http://portal.webconverger.com/bg.png).
