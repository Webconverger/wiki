Please help test the very latest [daily build images](http://build.webconverger.org/). Report bugs on [webc-users](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/topics). Once verified, bugs are listed on the [[todo]] list.

# qemu

`qemu -cdrom binary.iso`

Qemu might be a little slow if you don't have the qemu kernel module running.

# VMware

Windows or linux users can download [VMWARE player](http://www.vmware.com/download/player/download.html), which is free of cost.

Save the configuration below as a file named `webconverger.vmx` with webconverger.iso in the same directory. Run with VMWARE's player.

    # VM Machine Info
    guestOS = "linux"
    displayName = "Webconverger"
    config.version = "7"
    memsize = "128"

    # CDROM Info
    ide1:0.present = "TRUE"
    ide1:0.fileName = "webconverger.iso"
    ide1:0.deviceType = "cdrom-image"

    #Floppy Info
    floppy0.present = "FALSE"

    #Ethernet Info
    Ethernet0.present = "TRUE"
    ethernet0.addressType = "generated"

    # Audio Settings

# Testing video idea

[Videos](http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-4095341796996048842&hl=en-GB) with [Brendan's autotesting script](http://git.debian.org/?p=debian-live/autotesting.git).

Problem is the process is quite CPU intensive.
