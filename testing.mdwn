Please help test the very latest [daily build

# [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org) >= 4.2

**NOTE**: You need to set at least 1G of RAM

Setting a bridged network interface is straightforward, you just need to ensure:

	sudo modprobe -a vboxnetadp vboxnetflt

## Testing branches

With `fetch-revision=` from [[upgrade]] we can test experimental [branches](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/branches), before they are merged to master.

Here is a [video explaining how to make Webconverger switch branches for testing](http://r2d2.webconverger.org/2012-11-05/branches.html).

## Testing network failure

Network use cases:

1. Boot with network - should work normally
* Boot with network and later become disconnected - [should retry](https://github.com/Webconverger/iceweasel-webconverger/blob/master/content/netError.xhtml#L415)
* Boot without network - should show no-net.png
* Boot without network and become connected - should come back online
* Boot connected to router, but router has no internet connectivity - should show no-net.png
* Boot connected to router, with router regaining internet connectivity after 2 minutes

Think of cases where network comes online but configuration is failed to be fetched.

"debug mode" will bypass no-net.png

## PAE in 14.x

	21:32 <Talasar> How do I get webconverger to boot using virtual box?
	21:32 <Talasar> Just downloaded 14.1 and it stops loading when I have the choice to select "live" or "install"
	21:33 <Talasar> It does the 10 sec count down then nothing
	21:33 <blathijs> weird
	21:34 <blathijs> You should be able to select live and it should start booting
	21:34 <blathijs> You do need to enable "PAE/NX" in Settings -> System -> Processor
	21:34 <blathijs> but I'd say that would only be a problem later on
	21:34 <Talasar> It never leaves that menu screen.  the countdown stops at 1
	21:35 <Talasar> if I hit enter sooner it has the same effect.  It just stops
	21:35 <blathijs> Perhaps it tries to boot and then the kernel crashes because of no PAE (and the quiet option supresses the error mesage)
	21:36 <Talasar> hey your good!!  That did the trick clicking the pae/nx box
	21:36 <Talasar> Thanks!!
	21:37 <Talasar> Off to play with it.  Thanks again
