# [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org) >= 4.2

**NOTE**: You need to <a href="/img/pae.png">enable PAE</a> and if your VM fails to boot try give it more RAM

Setting a bridged network interface is straightforward, you just need to ensure:

	sudo modprobe -a vboxnetadp vboxnetflt

## Testing branches from the install version

With `fetch-revision=` from [[upgrade]] we can test experimental [branches](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/branches), before they are merged to master.

Here is a [video explaining how to get an installed Webconverger to switch branches for testing](http://r2d2.webconverger.org/2012-11-05/branches.html).

## Testing network failure

Network use cases:

1. Boot with network - should work normally
* Boot with network and later become disconnected - [should retry](https://github.com/Webconverger/iceweasel-webconverger/blob/master/content/netError.xhtml#L415)
* Boot without network - should show no-net.png
* Boot without network and become connected - should come back online
* Boot connected to router, but router has no internet connectivity - should show no-net.png
* Boot connected to router, with router regaining internet connectivity after 2 minutes

Think of cases where network comes online but configuration is failed to be fetched.

"debug mode" will bypass no-net.png

# Important elements to test before delivery

## [[wireless]] can only be realistically tested on physical hardware (i.e. not under virtualisation)
