As an IT manager you need to know about the product life cycle.


1. How long will you have vendor support for your system?
2. When will you be forced to "upgrade" to a new different version at some undefined cost?
3. How consistently can you source existing specifications?

For Windows (WIN32), you may be forced to upgrade to the Windows Vista package:

1. [WinXP will be supported until 2014](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/lifecycle/default.mspx)
2. The costs of upgrading to Vista are considered very high.
3. [WinXP will only be sold until Jan 2008](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6551429.stm)

In some cases your vendor won't tell you when they will cut off support for
fixes and security updates. They often force you to purchase a new "upgrade"
version when you are not prepared to do so.

## Using the Web platform

The Web is a fantastic open independent platform to base a corporate IT's needs
upon. You can configure your desktops to provide a stable up to date browser
platform using a variety of solutions.

Webconverger positions itself as the easiest way to get generic PC hardware
running a Firefox based Web platform to access Web applications over the
Internet.

If Webconverger became unsuitable, then you could swap it out for [Chromium
OS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_OS), Ubuntu or even Windows running
Opera for example. Choosing the Web & Webconverger, gets you out of an [vendor
lock-in](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in).
