This is a package list of all the Debian packages contained in this version (6.2) of Webconverger.

This is very useful to know the exact version number of individual packages
contained in the images, in order to know which packages (and hence
[[features]]) are included.

For example:

* If the **cupsys** package is not included, you then know that particular version does not have any [[printing]] support.
