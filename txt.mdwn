You may have noticed .txt (text files) like:

    webc-2.29.en.txt


This is a package list of all the Debian packages contained in this version (2.29) of Webconverger.

This is very useful to know the exact version number of individual packages contained in the images, ignoring [[upgrade]]s.


Also it is good to know which packages (and hence [[features]]) are included. 

For example: 

* If the **cupsys** package is not included, you then know that particular version does not have any [[printing]] support.
* If **iceweasel-l10n-fr** and **myspell-fr** in [maxi.txt](http://download.webconverger.com/maxi.txt) then you know [[maxi]] contains [[i18n]] localisations for the browser and spell checking for the [French language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language).

See [[mini]] and [[maxi]] for explanations of the different main configurations of Webconverger.
