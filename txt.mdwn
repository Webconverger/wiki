    webc-2.29.en.txt


This is a package list of all the Debian packages contained in this version (2.29) of Webconverger.

This is very useful to know the exact version number of individual packages contained in the images, ignoring [[upgrade]]s.


Also it is good to know which packages are included. 

For example if the **cupsys** package is not included, you know the image does not have any [[printing]] support.

If the **Tor** package is included, you know that image has some sort of anonymous browsing support.


See [[mini]] and [[maxi]] for explanations of the different main configurations of Webconverger.
