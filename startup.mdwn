Once the network is setup, on a Debian system **etc/network/if-up.d** is run,
however in many cases in our experience only the interface is up and not the
network neccessarily.

Therefore we have:

[/etc/network/if-up.d/after-network-up](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/network/if-up.d/after-network-up)

Which runs scripts in [/etc/webc/network-up.d](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/tree/master/etc/webc/network-up.d)

# [/etc/webc/live-config.sh](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/tree/master/etc/webc/live-config.sh) controlled via [inittab](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/inittab#L60)

These are items that need to be run as root.

This is not the place where things can be run as the user.

logs() is defined in [/etc/webc/webc.conf](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc/webc.conf)

	logs ()
	{
	logger -t $0 -p daemon.info "$@"
	}

# [/home/webc/.xinitrc](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/tree/master/home/webc/.xinitrc)

These are items that can run as the **webc** user

Note that only the bottom loop runs between browser sessions. For settings to
take effect, it's best to reboot the machine.
