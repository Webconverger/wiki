[[!meta title="Webconverger Limited's Terms and Conditions"]]

The canonical location of Webconverger's Terms and Conditions is
<http://webconverger.org/terms>.

It comes complete with a [changelog](http://source.webconverger-org.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=history;f=terms.mdwn;hb=HEAD) and is subject to change.

### Interpretation

This agreement is written in plain English and should be read as such. This
agreement is subject to English law in the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom.

We have used the terms we, us, our, etc to mean Webconverger Ltd, and you,
your, etc to mean the customer to whom we are providing services.  We are
Webconverger Limited, a company registered in England and Wales number 6366403
and in Singapore number 201211208C.

### Limitations of liability

We understand that ongoing operation of services we provide is important to you
but we expect you to understand that services can fail for a variety of
reasons. It is also possible for us to make mistakes.  As such we expect you to
take whatever precautions or insurances against such failure or mistakes as you
see fit, including situations where we may be negligent.

We limit any liability for consequential losses or tort or any other liabilities
to the amount that you paid.

If we are negligent, then we accept that we have liability. We require you to
prove we have been negligent in such cases. We require you to demonstrate
actual losses for your claim. We require you to take all reasonable steps to
minimise your losses.

Whilst there are no limits on our liability for death or personally injury due
to negligence, we limit our liability for any other negligence or any other
reasons to a refund of the amount paid for the failed goods or services. (We
also make it a condition that you do not use any of our services in any safety
of life situations where a failure could cause death or personal injury). You
agree to this limit whether we are negligent, or not, and even for liabilities
that somehow occur when we are not in breach of contract with you.

It is important to realise what this means. Basically, in most cases, if we
mess up, the most you can get is your money back. Some of our services are very
cheap and some are even free of charge, so this is not a lot of compensation.
If this is a problem, then you should look at getting your own insurance or
buying services from someone else. When you order goods or services from us you
are agreeing to these limits of liability.

These terms do not affect your statutory rights, and apply to the full extent
that the law permits them to within those rights.

### License of Webconverger

The Webconverger operating system is based on opensource software, with notable
exceptions of non-free wireless firmware and Adobe flash. You must understand
that the branding (logo and the name "Webconverger") are proprietary. Only our
Webconverger built images can display the logo and can be sold as
"Webconverger".

### Services

Services of Webconverger are our support, the [configuration
manager](http://config.webconverger.com) and our customised ISOs.

If you derive services from us, you must maintain a subscription, i.e. you must
pay for services you use.

If you fail to maintain a subscription for example by missing payment, we
reserve the right to terminate service and reset Webconverger to its
unconfigured defaults.

### Termination

Termination of service means the nullification of your configuration, which in
turn resets Webconverger to its defaults. Webconverger at its unconfigured or
uncustomised defaults can be used without payment.

It is a violation of the contract to circumvent termination, by for example
using a customised ISO without paying. You must continue to pay or stop using
the service. We are able to tell if customers are using customised ISOs without
payment by our ping service described in [[privacy]].

### Privacy policy

Please refer to the [Webconverger privacy policy](http://webconverger.org/privacy/).

### Service levels

Our [service levels](http://webconverger.org/sla/) are supplied on a best
effort basis.

### Webconverger subscription terminology versus license

To avoid confusion with the opensource licensed Webconverger PC operating
system, we prefer to sell our managed PC services as "subscriptions" and not as
"licenses" as our competitors typically do.

Each subscription is mapped to a machine identity; a unique combination of a
PC's motherboard identifier and its MAC address. A "one off" subscription is
fixed to a particular machine identity and is non-transferable.

### Refunds

We offer a 30 day money back guarantee once service has begun. So if you begun
trial at the start of the month, made payment at the beginning of the second
week, you have until the end of that month to cancel for a refund.

We will immediately terminate service and return your money minus payment
transaction fees within 30 days after receiving notice.

### Payment fees

For bank transfers you must bear all the costs of the bank transfer.

### Credit terms

Unless we agree otherwise, invoices are due for payment immediately. We are
prepared to agree terms such as 14 days, 30 days or end of following month at
our discretion. Credit is not automatic or a right and we may withdraw or
change credit terms for future invoices if we wish. If you do not agree to the
terms stated on the invoice you must contact us immediately.

### Misc

If we don't enforce our contract terms at any point it doesn't mean we won't
later.

If we don't charge you for something right away it doesn't mean we won't charge
for it later.

These terms are not intended to benefit any third party as per Contracts
(Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

We may anonymously quote your bug reports on our public bug tracker.

We may anonymously quote comments from any emails or comments we receive unless
you specifically say we can't, e.g. for our testimonials page. We will normally
ask first.
