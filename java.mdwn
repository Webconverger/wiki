I discourage the use of Java on the Web, however some legacy Web applications
unfortunately require it. Such as [Norway's banking
applications](http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/BankID) which reminds me of the
brain dead [SEED](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEED) system utilised by banks
in Korea.

Debian packages require you to explicitly accept the license. We override that
in [Webconverger's
configuration](http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git)
like so:

	config$ cat preseed/sun-java6-jre.preseed
	sun-java6-jre   shared/accepted-sun-dlj-v1-1    boolean true

Next we need both the Java JRE & Web plugin for it to work in Webconverger:

	config$ tail -n2 package-lists/webc.list.chroot
	sun-java6-jre
	sun-java6-plugin
