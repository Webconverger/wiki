* No users - no superuser
* Stability & [security](/security/) of open source - based on GNU/Linux Debian stable releases
* No local user data - Locked down browser kiosk - for example no functionality to save bookmarks locally
* Less is more - Minimal packages for just the Web experience (though that includes [Adobe](/adobe/) flash and PDF support)
* Excellent [internationalization and localization](/i18n/) support
* Committed to user's [privacy](/privacy/)
* Zero maintenance - Automatic [upgrades](/upgrade/) using git
* (Long term) Universal commitment to all devices - Webconverger focuses currently runs on PCs, though with our [API](/boot/) we hope to support Android & other platforms
