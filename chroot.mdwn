# chroot for building (running Debian Live)

Webconverger relies on Debian Live to put the ISO together. Please create an
Unstable <abbr title="Still in Development">sid</abbr>-chroot like so in
`~/debian`:

	cd ~/debian
	sudo debootstrap sid sid-root http://cdn.debian.net/debian/

[debootstrap](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=2970) is available in other Linux distros like Archlinux.

Then `sudo chroot ~/debian/sid-root`, and apt-get install as follows:

	apt-get install live-build git make sudo squashfs-tools syslinux genisoimage librsvg2-bin

Clone a copy of <https://github.com/Webconverger/Debian-Live-config> into root's home directory like so:

	git clone git://github.com/Webconverger/Debian-Live-config.git /root
	cd
	make

# the Webconverger chroot within the build chroot

The
[Makefile](https://github.com/Webconverger/Debian-Live-config/blob/master/webconverger/Makefile)
should clone the [Webconverger chroot](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc)
from a read only github URL set in the
[Makefile](https://github.com/Webconverger/Debian-Live-config/blob/master/webconverger/Makefile)

Your remotes should look like:

	origin git://github.com/Webconverger/webc.git (fetch)
	origin git@github.com:Webconverger/webc.git (push)

So you can make an authenticated push outside the chroot from the host system.

# Handy shortcuts

Next I've created a few aliases to help me navigate around that structure:

To enter the chroot and add/remove packages for example. `c; apt-get update && apt-get install something`

	alias c="sudo chroot ~/debian/sid-root/root/webconverger/chroot"

To build the ISO, I enter: `b; make`

	alias b="sudo chroot ~/debian/sid-root"

`i` gets me to the top level directory so I can do work from my host system.

	alias i="cd ~/debian/sid-root/root/webconverger"

Whenever I drop out of the chroot, I run `up` to push the change [up to github](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/commits/master).

	up() {
		cd ~/debian/sid-root/root/webconverger/chroot
		git push
	}

Sidenote: Isn't it silly how you can write shortcuts using `alias` or a function in bash?

# Keeping your git user configuration in the the chroot

	x220:~$ grep GIT ~/.bashrc
	export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Your Name"
	export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="Your Name"
	export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=you@example.com
	export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=you@example.com

Have a link like this in your `/etc/sudoers`

	Defaults    env_keep+=SSH_AUTH_SOCK,env_keep+=GIT_*

So when you run `sudo chroot`, it should have your basic git settings.

# Work flow

If you can think of optimisations, please let me know! Lets assume for example
I'm tweaking
<https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc/webc.conf>.

First I go, `c` which chroots me into [webc
rootfs](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc). I make an
edit. I add and commit than change, otherwise git-fs will not pick up that
change. Then I exit the terminal and drop back in the host system.

Then I go `b` to get into the Debian sid-chroot with [Debian Live build
script](https://github.com/Webconverger/Debian-Live-config). I run `make` and
builds the ISO.

Once the ISO is built I launch [[Virtualbox|testing]] and test
`binary.hybrid.iso`.

# Making a release

We use the <http://build.webconverger.org/> service on [[hetty|servers]] which
`git clone --depth 1` the chroot for a the smallest size distribution.
