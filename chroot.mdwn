# Developing without `make chroot`

GOAL: make development iterations faster.

Clone the repo <https://github.com/Webconverger/webc>

Save the following script as `chroot.sh`

	chroot=webc
	mount -o bind /sys $chroot/sys
	mount -o bind /proc $chroot/proc
	mount -o bind /dev $chroot/dev # urandom et al
	mount -o bind /tmp $chroot/tmp # socket communication
	chroot $chroot
	umount $chroot/sys
	umount $chroot/proc
	umount $chroot/dev
	umount $chroot/tmp

On the host, run:

	Xephyr -ac :1

Now `sudo ./chroot.sh`

# Sanity check

	export DISPLAY=:1

As root, run `dwm`. And ctrl+c

Running `xterm` will not work due to /dev/pts not being correctly populated. Not sure how to fix this.

	Reason: get_pty: not enough ptys

# Booting webc

	export DISPLAY=:1

Might need to create the webc user first.

	cd /home/webc
	./.xinitrc

You might want to remove the trap from `.xinitrc` to make debugging easier.

# Potential gotchas

All sorts of wierd pollution can happen since you share /sys, /proc, /tmp and /dev

When you exit the chroot, scripts are still left running in the chroot, see [[startup]] for potential culprits.
