[[!meta title="Internationalization and localization"]]

From Webconverger 12 there are several ways to setup the locale and keyboard.

# At boot

1. By using or modifying syslinux [[boot]] menu. There are already some [asked for choices](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/webc-users/a-E98XTTAD8/wgeBRQUme4gJ) there for you to try
2. Building you own ISO and appending the [[boot]] option to --bootappend-live in the [config](https://github.com/Webconverger/Debian-Live-config/blob/master/webconverger/auto/config)

# Once booted

3. By using the new [customisation service](http://config.webconverger.com), filling in a form and purchasing a subscription
4. Using a locale switcher in the browser chrome

# i18n support falls into a couple of areas

1. Setting up the browser UI using `locale=` and using a single [ISO 639 code](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php)
2. Keyboard options using for example `xkb=-layout%20gb` options are simply URL encoded
3. More complex CJK input methods, which we can support, though not atm

The first locale setting is also set in the Accept languages in the browser. <https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc/live-config.sh#L39>

`xkb` replaces `keyboard-layouts=` from Debian Live and now gives you direct
and convienant access to
[setxkbmap](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=setxkbmap).

<https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/home/webc/.xinitrc#L39> is how Webconverger parses and runs the option to `setxkbmap`.

For existing Linux users, this is how to setup a British keyboard and query its settings:

	$ setxkbmap -layout gb
	$ setxkbmap -query
	rules:      evdev
	model:      evdev
	layout:     gb
	options:    "grp:caps_toggle",grp:caps_toggle,ctrl:nocaps

To encode the argument string, simply launch a browser console and use the Javascript function `encodeURI`.

	encodeURI("-layout gb")
	"-layout%20gb"
