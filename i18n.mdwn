[[!meta title="Internationalization and localization"]]

There are several ways to setup the locale and keyboard. We have good support
for European languages and we will (re)address Asian requirements in the
future.

# At boot

1. By using or modifying syslinux [[boot]] menu. There are already some [requested choices](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/webc-users/a-E98XTTAD8/wgeBRQUme4gJ) included
2. Building you own ISO and appending the [[boot]] option to `--bootappend-live` in the [config](https://github.com/Webconverger/Debian-Live-config/blob/master/webconverger/auto/config)

# Once booted

3. By using the [customisation service](http://config.webconverger.com), filling in a form and purchasing a subscription
4. Using a locale switcher in the browser chrome (still under development)

# i18n support falls into a couple of areas

1. Setting up the browser UI using `locale=` and using a single [ISO 639 code](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php)
2. Keyboard options using the `xkb=` mapping to **setxkbmap**, for example `xkb=-layout%20gb`. Spaces are URL encoded.
3. More complex CJK input methods via [SCIM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Common_Input_Method), which we can support, though not because of current ISO size constraints

The first locale setting is also set in the Accept languages in the browser.
<https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc/live-config.sh#L39>

`xkb` replaces `keyboard-layouts=` from Debian Live and now gives you direct
and convienant access to
[setxkbmap](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=setxkbmap).

<https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/home/webc/.xinitrc#L39> is how Webconverger parses and runs the option to `setxkbmap`.

In [[debug_mode|boot]], this is how to setup a British keyboard and query its settings:

	$ setxkbmap -layout gb
	$ setxkbmap -query
	rules:      evdev
	model:      evdev
	layout:     gb
	options:    "grp:caps_toggle",grp:caps_toggle,ctrl:nocaps

To encode the argument string, simply launch a browser console and use the
Javascript function
[encodeURI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURI).
Or you can just replace spaces with `%20`.

	encodeURI("-layout gb")
	"-layout%20gb"

Which becomes `xkb=-layout%20gb` in your Webconverger configuration.

# Switching keyboard layouts

You can switch keyboard layouts using a special key combination. For example,
in debug mode or in any Linux Xorg terminal:

	setxkbmap -layout us,th -option grp:shift_toggle

Allows you to toggle between US and Thai keyboard layouts by pressing both left
and right [SHIFT keys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_key) together.

To configure Webconverger with this preference, you append:

	xkb=-layout%20us,th%20-option%20grp:shift_toggle

Caveat: [Do not quote your commands](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/issues/25).

In the future we might add a
[widget](http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Change_keyboard_maps) to toggle
inputs.

There are setxkbmap aliases which can be found in [/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst)

# Fonts

In the above example we can enable Thai input, however Webconverger does not
currently ship a [Thai
font](http://packages.qa.debian.org/t/thaifonts-scalable.html) because of size
constraits in the default ISO.

Over time we will include more fonts. It depends on demand, please contact us.
