Webconverger has great support for worldwide cultures on boot. If you need to
switch keyboard layouts, this is possible to configure using the `keyboard-layouts=`
switch. See the Russian example.

# Setting up Webconverger for your locale

Specify them on the [[boot]] parameter prompt.

The Debian-Live build option is set **auto/config** like so:

        --bootappend-live ".... locales=en_GB.UTF-8 keyboard-layouts=gb"

Sometimes a two letter shorthand for some locales (please test) may work for you.

# Tested locales

### Swiss German
locales=de_CH.UTF-8 keyboard-layouts=ch keyboard-variant=de
### Denmark
locales=da_DK.UTF-8 keyboard-layouts=dk
### Chinese
locales=zh_CN.UTF-8 keyboard-layouts=zh
### German
locales=de keyboard-layouts=de
### Spanish
locales=es keyboard-layouts=es
### French
locales=fr
### Italian
locales=it
### Japanese
locales=ja_JP.UTF-8
### Korean
locales=ko_KR.UTF-8
### Finnish
locales=fi keyboard-layouts=fi
### Norwegian Bokm√•l
locales=nb_NO.UTF-8 keyboard-layouts=no
### Norwegian Nynorsk
locales=nn_NO.UTF-8 keyboard-layouts=no

# Testing
Please check and test different locales. If they work (or don't!), please
contribute that information to the wiki. :)

### Hungarian

	locales=hu keyboard-layouts=hu

### Latvian

	locales=lv_LV.UTF-8 keyboard-layouts=lv,ru,us keyboard-options=grp:switch,grp:alt_shift_toggle,grp_led:scroll

### Russian

	locales=ru_RU.UTF-8 keyboard-layouts=us,ru keyboard-options=grp:alt_shift_toggle

Like Windows you press Alt+Shift to toggle between Cyrillic and Latin keyboard layouts.

# Does your locale have a translation for the browser?

Search for your code under 'Binaries' of [browser locale packages](http://packages.qa.debian.org/i/iceweasel-l10n.html).

# Chinese support example

At the [[boot]] menu, entering `live locales=zh_CN.UTF-8 keyboard-layouts=zh` as [this picture](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/850230357) demonstrates, sets up Webconverger for the Chinese locale.

Once booted in Chinese, or Japanese and Korean environments **CONTROL+SPACE** allows to switch between keyboard input modes via [scim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCIM).

Please give feedback about anything. If you don't like the font or see some other rendering problem, I am very interested to solve these problems.

# How [CJK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK) support works

* [Chinese](http://git.debian.org/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=blob;f=webconverger/config/includes.chroot/etc/network/if-up.d/chinese)
* [Japanese](http://git.debian.org/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=blob;f=webconverger/config/includes.chroot/etc/network/if-up.d/japanese)
* [Korean](http://git.debian.org/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=blob;f=webconverger/config/includes.chroot/etc/network/if-up.d/korean)

CJK support requires a bunch of extra fonts and complex logic for the input
system.  Since most Webconverger users currently are Western, it seems a little
unfair to bloat the image by 100M+ for locale support rarely used Asian input
methods.

So CJK is currently supported by downloading the locale support packages on
startup from <http://cdn.debian.net/debian/> with a **if-up.d** hook.

Currently this "on network ready" hook is a little fragile. Sometimes the
network isn't quite 100% ready on a if-up.d hook. Please help identify issues
by [[testing]] and [reporting bugs](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users).
Please do not be embarrassed by your English language skills, the list is very
friendly!

Ideally place an order for a [customised copy of
Webconverger](http://webconverger.com/buy) with these CJK support packages in
an image for you.

Any suggestions to improve this locale support mechanism would be
[[acknowledged|acknowledgements]].
