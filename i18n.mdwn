# Keyboard switching

For current versions of Webconverger these internationalization settings only affect X/keyboard.

Specify them on the boot prompt. For British English configurations:

        LIVE_BOOTAPPEND="locale=en_GB.UTF-8 keyb=uk"

or

        LIVE_BOOTAPPEND="locale=uk"


The default is the standard American settings as their keyboard layout is the
most common. Lookup your country's codes at [ISO 3166](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#MM).

Check they are supported in Debian 'etch' by checking the country code is in `/usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED`

Sometimes a two letter shorthand for some locales may work for you. Try `locale=fr` for French for example.

# Tested locales

#### German
locale=de_CH.UTF-8 keyb=ch kvariant=de
#### Chinese
locale=zh_CN.UTF-8 keyb=zh
#### German
locale=de keyb=de
#### Spanish
locale=es keyb=es
#### French
locale=fr
#### Italian
locale=it
#### Japanese
locale=ja_JP.UTF-8
#### Korean
locale=ko_KR.UTF-8

### Testing
#### Hungarian
locale=hu keyb=hu

locale=lv_LV.UTF-8 keyb=lv,ru,us vga=773 koptions=grp:switch,grp:alt_shift_toggle,grp_led:scroll"
locale=ru_RU.UTF-8 keyb=ru


# Chinese support example

When Webconverger initially boots up, these is a short delay when one can enter additional commands on the boot parameter.

Entering `live locale=zh_CN.UTF-8 keyb=zh` as [this picture](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/850230357) demonstrates, sets up Webconverger for the Chinese locale.

Once booted into the browser, **CONTROL+SPACE** allows to switch between keyboard input modes via [scim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCIM).

Please give feedback about anything. If you don't like the font or see some other rendering problem, I am very interested to solve these problems.
