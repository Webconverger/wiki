# Setting up Webconverger for your locale

Specify them on the boot prompt. For example British English configurations:

        LIVE_BOOTAPPEND="locale=en_GB.UTF-8 keyb=uk"

or

        LIVE_BOOTAPPEND="locale=uk"

Sometimes a two letter shorthand for some locales may work for you.

# Tested locales

### German
locale=de_CH.UTF-8 keyb=ch kvariant=de
### Chinese
locale=zh_CN.UTF-8 keyb=zh
### German
locale=de keyb=de
### Spanish
locale=es keyb=es
### French
locale=fr
### Italian
locale=it
### Japanese
locale=ja_JP.UTF-8
### Korean
locale=ko_KR.UTF-8

# Testing

Please check and test different locales. If they work (or don't!), please
contribute that information to the wiki. :)

### Hungarian
locale=hu keyb=hu
### Latvian
locale=lv_LV.UTF-8 keyb=lv,ru,us vga=773 koptions=grp:switch,grp:alt_shift_toggle,grp_led:scroll
### Russian
locale=ru_RU.UTF-8 keyb=ru


# Chinese support example

When Webconverger initially boots up, these is a short delay when one can enter additional commands on the boot parameter.

Entering `live locale=zh_CN.UTF-8 keyb=zh` as [this picture](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/850230357) demonstrates, sets up Webconverger for the Chinese locale.

Once booted in Chinese, Japanese and Korean environments **CONTROL+SPACE** allows to switch between keyboard input modes via [scim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCIM).

Please give feedback about anything. If you don't like the font or see some other rendering problem, I am very interested to solve these problems.
