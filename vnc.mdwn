# Remote desktop

Some customers require "remote desktop" functionality and this is accomplished
with the "x11vnc - VNC server to allow remote access to an existing X session"
package.

Basically this allows the administrator to view the user's screen.

The advantage is that the user can be guided remotely through an application.
The disadvantage however is that the administrator could spy on what the user
is doing, without the user's knowledge. Ideally the user would be warned that
the administrator is now also viewing the screen, however this sort of
warning/information dialogue does not exist in Webconverger.

Therefore by default **x11vnc** will _not_ be in (uncustomised) versions of
Webconverger as VNC inherently does not protect the privacy of users.

# Howto connect to $client

client=172.16.181.1 in my example.

Connect to client with [[ssh]] and start VNC server

	ssh 172.16.181.1
	user@webconverger:~$ x11vnc -passwd CHANGEME

Connect to VNC server

	xvncviewer 172.16.181.128:5900

[VNC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNC) is not a secure protocol, however lets
assume clients who require this feature are running Webconverger in some sort
of secure intranet.
