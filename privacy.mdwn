# Privacy policy

Webconverger is designed to ensure users privacy and [[security]] whilst
surfing the Web, primarily by wiping the slate clean between sessions.
Therefore public users of a Webconverger kiosks do not have to fear they are
leaving any private data behind.

Webconverger does not record your search history or collect any data of your
surfing habits.

Webconverger send to our servers on boot:

* Machine identity, your machine UUID + MAC address
* IP address from where you sent it from
* Version of Webconverger you use

## Ping

* [ping client source](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc/network-up.d/ping)
* [ping receiver source](https://github.com/Webconverger/ping/blob/master/index.php)

This "ping" is used to determine how many users Webconverger has to warrant
further investment. [Public usage statistics](http://ping.webconverger.org/).

You can opt out by appending `noping` to the command line.

## Configuration service

By default (unless opted by specifying `noconfig`), we direct you to our
[configuration service](http://config.webconverger.com). This configuration
service can see your machine UUID and MAC address. We use these machine
identifiers (not personally identifying), to track and apply subscriptions made
with our [configuration service](http://config.webconverger.com). This is how
the company generates revenue in order to support the opensource project.

All *.webconverger.[com|org] sites have standard [Apache](http://apache.org/)
logs, which will log when you visit that site. Logs are typically rotated
(deleted) within a year (Debian defaults). [Google
Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) are also enabled on some of the
sites.

We try to make the privacy policy as clear as possible. If you have any
questions please ask privacy AT webconverger.com.
