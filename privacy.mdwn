# Privacy policy

Webconverger is designed to ensure users privacy and [[security]] whilst
surfing the Web, primarily by wiping the slate clean between sessions.
Therefore public users of a Webconverger kiosks do not have to fear they are
leaving any private data behind.

Webconverger does not record your search history or collect any data of your
surfing habits.

Webconverger collects an anonymous "ping" with the version number and boot
device:

* [ping client source](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc/network-up.d/ping)
* [ping receiver source](https://github.com/Webconverger/ping/blob/master/index.php)

This "ping" is used to determine how many users Webconverger has to warrant
further investment. [Public usage statistics](http://ping.webconverger.org/).

By default (unless opted by specifying `noconfig`), we direct you to our
configuration service. This configuration service can see your machine UUID and
MAC address. We use these machine identifiers (not personally identifying), to
track and apply subscriptions made with our [configuration
service](http://config.webconverger.com). This how the company generates
revenue in order to support the opensource project.

All *.webconverger.[com|org] sites have standard [Apache](http://apache.org/)
logs, which will log when you visit that site. Logs are typically rotated
(deleted) within a year (Debian defaults). [Google
Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) are also enabled on some of the
sites.

We try to make the privacy policy as clear as possible. If you have any
questions please ask privacy AT webconverger.com.
