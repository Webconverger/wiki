# Privacy policy

Webconverger is designed to ensure users privacy and [[security]] whilst
surfing the Web.

Webconverger limited from version 7 collects an anonymous "ping" with the
version number of webconverger-base.

* [ping client source](https://github.com/Webconverger/Debian-Live-config/blob/master/webconverger/config/includes.chroot/etc/network/if-up.d/ping)
* [ping receiver source](http://ping.webconverger.org/hgweb.cgi)

This "ping" is used to determine how many users Webconverger has to warrant
further investment. [Public usage statistics are available](http://ping.webconverger.org/)

All *.webconverger.[com|org] sites have standard [Apache](http://apache.org/)
logs, which will log when you visit that site. Logs are typically rotated
(deleted) within a year. [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/)
are also enabled.

If you are concerned about your privacy, use Webconverger.
