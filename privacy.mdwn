# Privacy policy

Webconverger is designed to ensure users privacy and [[security]] whilst
surfing the Web.

Webconverger limited from version 7 collects an anonymous "ping" with the
version number of webconverger-base.

* [ping client source](http://git.debian.org/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=blob;f=webconverger/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/network/if-up.d/ping;)
* [ping receiver source](http://ping.webconverger.org/hgweb.cgi)

This "ping" is used to determine how many users Webconverger has to warrant
further investment.

All *.webconverger.[com|org] sites have standard [Apache](http://apache.org/)
logs, which will log when you visit that site. Logs are typically rotated
(deleted) within a year.

If you are concerned about your privacy, use Webconverger.
