# Privacy policy

Webconverger is designed to ensure users privacy and security whilst surfing
the Web.

This is chiefly accomplished by deleting the Firefox `~/.mozilla` directory
between sessions.

Webconverger Ltd does not currently collect any information about how you use
Webconverger.  Earlier versions (before 2.31) were collecting version, boot
parameters (e.g. homepage=) and MAC information.

All *.webconverger.[com|org] sites have standard [Apache](http://apache.org/)
logs, which will log you if you visit that site. Logs are typically rotated
(deleted) within a year.

# Customised Webconverger

Webconverger can however be [customised](http://webconverger.com/buy/) for
[[remote_desktop_sharing|vnc]] and similar features for remote administration.
This can allow an administrator spy your browsing session.

# Surf with SSL to protect yourself from eavesdropping

It's important to understand the [[security]] risks of general Web browsing.
The good scope of Web security is difficult to address in this document,
however you should know the basics.

When you surf the in most cases your browsing connection can be intercepted.
That's if the attacker can get inbetween you and your favourite Website. So who
could be in between your connection and say this site Webconverger.org?
Typically it's only the network administrator on both ends and most likely your
network administrator.

A "network administrator" is someone who can sniff packets. This is quite easy
to do with unsecured Wireless. However this is a way you can get around this
problem, and that's to use [SSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer).

An encrypted SSL connection is denoted by a yellow coloured URL bar. So for example instead of visiting:

* http://gmail.com

A more secure & simple way to protect from evesdropping is to visit instead:

* https://gmail.com

Notice the difference? [https](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Https) instead of
the "clear" network messages of the much more common
[http](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http).
