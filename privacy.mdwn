# Privacy policy

Webconverger is designed to ensure users privacy and [[security]] whilst
surfing the Web, primarily by wiping the slate clean between sessions.
Therefore public users of a Webconverger kiosks do not have to fear they are
leaving any private data behind.

Webconverger does not record your search history or collect any data of your
surfing habits.

Webconverger from version 7 collects an anonymous "ping" with the version
number of webconverger-base.

* [ping client source](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/network/if-up.d/ping)
* [ping receiver source](https://github.com/Webconverger/ping/blob/master/index.php)

This "ping" is used to determine how many users Webconverger has to warrant
further investment. [Public usage statistics are available](http://ping.webconverger.org/)

From Webconverger 12, by default (unless opted out by changing the homepage),
we direct you to our configuration service. This configuration service can see
your machine UUID and MAC address. We use these machine identifiers (not
personally identifying), to track subscriptions made with our [configuration
service](http://config.webconverger.com)

All *.webconverger.[com|org] sites have standard [Apache](http://apache.org/)
logs, which will log when you visit that site. Logs are typically rotated
(deleted) within a year. [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/)
are also enabled on some of the sites.

We try to make the privacy policy as clear as possible. If you have any
questions please ask privacy AT webconverger.com.
