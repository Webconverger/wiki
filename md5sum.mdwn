You may have noticed files with a .MD5SUM suffix such as:

    webc-2.29.en.iso.MD5SUM

This is a file containing a checksum. This is to verify the downloaded image file is not corrupt. For example:

    monty:~/images% cat webc-2.29.mini.iso.MD5SUM
    9f65b24422bb92224f7c54bf911dad59  /home/hendry/www/mini/webc-2.29.mini.iso
    monty:~/images% md5sum webc-2.29.mini.iso       
    9f65b24422bb92224f7c54bf911dad59  webc-2.29.mini.iso

Above the MD5SUMs match, which means the original checksum is the same as my local checksum. The image is now verified.
