# Customising [iso-hybrid](http://git.debian-maintainers.org/?p=syslinux/syslinux.git;a=blob;f=doc/isolinux.txt#l80)

No need for separate [[img|usb]] and [[iso]] files. **One** ISO HYBRID file can
do **both**. You can burn the ISO and also image the same file to a USB stick.

The reason why [Webconverger has a commercial customisation
service](http://webconverger.com/buy) is that it used to be very difficult to
make trivial changes to the [[boot_command_line|boot]].
[[Thanks|acknowledgements]] to
[nils](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/msg/9379c3da15f08e6d) and to
[Daniel Baumann](http://blog.daniel-baumann.ch) especially for his hard work on this
[Debian Live](http://debian-live.alioth.debian.org/) feature, customisation has become
a lot easier for you.

The customisation steps are something like:

	mount -o loop webc-6.1.iso /mnt/webc/
	rsync -av /mnt/webc /mnt/custom
	chmod +w /mnt/custom/isolinux/live.cfg

Now edit `/mnt/custom/isolinux/live.cfg` and change the [[boot]] command line
with your homepage URL.

Now rebuild the ISO like so:

	mkisofs -o /tmp/custom-webc.iso -b -r -J -l -cache-inodes -allow-multidot -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table \
	-b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat /mnt/custom

Finally:

	/usr/bin/isohybrid /tmp/custom-webc.iso

`isohybrid` comes from a recent version of [syslinux](http://packages.debian.org/unstable/syslinux-common)

The [customisation service](http://webconverger.com/buy) remains if you are unable to perform these commands.
It's also difficult to edit the package listing, such as changing [[chrome|kiosk]]
without the [service](http://webconverger.com/buy) still. For
[[large_deployments|press]], please enquire with sales in how we can help you.
