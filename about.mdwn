[[meta title="Webconverger Comparison Matrix"]]

# Introduction

<p>Webconverger is an evolution of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_client">hybrid client</a> for
deployments in places like offices or Internet cafes where only <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application">Web applications</a> are
used.</p>

<p>Unlike <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_clients">thin</a> or <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_client">hybrid</a> clients,
Webconverger is faster and more responsive by providing a up-to-date Web browser that runs
locally.</p>

## Microsoft Steady State

[Microsoft Steady
State](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/sharedaccess/) is
based on a vanilla Windows XP installation. If a malicous hacker is out to
break it, he will as the image is not updated.  An AV-program (with certain
scripts to write virus update signatures into the Steadystate cache, otherwise
AV updates would be swept off after every reboot...) is still required as a
virus could for example infect the MBR, corrupt the Steadystate cache partition
and just mess up the system in general.

A complete reboot is required to clean up the system after the user leaves the
system, due to the nature of the system each reboot means that multiple
gigabyte of data are being copied from one partition to the other. That takes a
good 3-4 minutes on an average system and it's of course also pretty stressing
for the HD.

The good thing about Steadystate is that it allows me to offer a full Windows
XP installation with MS office, Skype, Instant-messaging software and whatnot
to the guests.  The downside is that it breaks continuously and is much more
trouble than it's worth to maintain when most people really just want to check
their webmail.  I could go on all day ranting about how something like Windows
XP with Steadystate is inferior to a Webconverger for my usage scenario here.

# Rationale

<p>Entrepreneurs are not developing for the Windows or the Linux desktop, they’re developing for the prevalent <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html">Web API platform</a>.</p>

<p>Likewise users are not checking their email with Outlook Express
anymore, they’re using Web applications such as Gmail or Yahoo. This is
Web convergence.</p>

<p>That leads us onto a <strong>problem</strong>. How does an IT manager roll
out the Web platform? We probably have to deal with fragile pre-installations
of Windows and battle to get Firefox on each machine. Then the hopeless battle
to maintain that system from viruses, spyware and the looming costs of a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Vista">Vista</a> update.</p>

<p><strong>The answer is Webconverger.</strong></p>

<p>Webconverger is simply a Web kiosk/terminal, that is easy to deploy and
secure. In most cases all you need to do is boot from a CD. That's it! A usable
up to date Web browser that <strong>just works</strong>.</p> 

<p><strong>The Web, just the Web and only the Web.</strong></p>
