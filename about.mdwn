## Why Webconverger for your Web kiosk?

* Simple & Tested & Reliable
* Good performance
* [[API]] for fine tuning it for your deployment
* Current, supporting the latest Web features
* Excellent [[security]]
* [[i18n]] support

Webconverger has sensible and sane defaults. [Supporting Webconverger through
payment](http://webconverger.com/faq/#what-does-a-subscription-buy-exactly),
gives you support and a [configuration management
tool](https://config.webconverger.com/) to help you maintain many machines with
your settings!

## Webconverger is much better compared than Microsoft Windows based products

<img src=/img/windows-update.jpg alt="Windows automatic updates are often broken or need manual input">

Don't forget to include the cost of Windows which is usually a hidden cost
forced upon [System
Integrators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_integrator).  The main cost
of Windows is its poor security track record and its poor Internet Explorer
experience.

To lock down a Windows machine, you need to purchase 3rd party software like
Kioware or SiteKiosk:

* [[blog/entry/SiteKiosk_versus_Webconverger]]

These third party software don't save you from the [maintenance headaches that
Windows
presents](https://webconverger.org/blog/2014/Webconverger_does_not_have_an_EOL/).

### Windows "Freezing" is not a secure approach

[Microsoft Steady State](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_SteadyState) has
been **discontinued**.

[Faronics](http://www.faronics.com/en-uk/) offers a comparable solution to
"freeze" the Windows machine. However "freezing" is not a good strategy for
providing users an uptodate and current browser experience like Webconverger
install users enjoy. "Deep Freeze" is comparable to <a
href="http://config.webconverger.com/faq/#what-do-you-mean-by-live-version-and-install-version-?">Webconverger's
Live version</a> which we plan to phase out over time in favour of the
"automatically uptodate" install version.

"Freezing" also does not guarantee any security for your users. For example a
vulnerable flash in a "frozen" Windows could be exploited each and every
browsing session, if the surfer unfortunately browses to the exploited every
session. If Webconverger discovers an exploit, it is quickly patched and
installs [[upgrade]] so that surfers are safe.
