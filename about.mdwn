monopoly on System Integrators.

## Windows "Freezing" approaches

[Microsoft Steady State](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_SteadyState) has
been **discontinued**.

[Faronics](http://www.faronics.com/en-uk/) offers a comparable solution to
"freeze" the Windows machine. However "freezing" is not a good strategy for
providing users an uptodate and current browser experience like Webconverger
install users enjoy. "Deep Freeze" is comparable to <a
href="http://config.webconverger.com/faq/#what-do-you-mean-by-live-version-and-install-version-?">Webconverger's
Live version</a> which we plan to phase out over time in favour of the
"automatically uptodate" install version.

"Freezing" also does not guarantee any security for your users. For example a
vulnerable flash in a "frozen" Windows could be exploited each and every
browsing session, if the surfer unfortunately browses to the exploited every
session. If Webconverger discovers an exploit, it is quickly patched and
installs [[upgrade]] so that surfers are safe.

# Why converge your application platform to the Web?

Entrepreneurs are not developing for the Windows or the Linux desktop, they are
developing for the prevalent <a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html">Web platform</a>.

Likewise users are not checking their email with Outlook Express anymore, they
are using Web applications such as Gmail or Yahoo. This is Web convergence.

That leads us onto a <strong>problem</strong>. How does an IT manager roll out
the Web platform? We probably have to deal with fragile pre-installations of
Windows and battle to get Firefox on each machine. Then the hopeless battle to
maintain that system from viruses, malware and the looming costs of a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Vista">Vista</a> (or worse)
update.

Webconverger is an easy to deploy and maintenance free platform for running
your Web applications.
