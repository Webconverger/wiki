1. Webconverger users do not require any registration, though you could sign up to the newsletter to keep abreast of updates.
2. Webconverger does not have the concept of users or super users (administrators) for that matter.
3. Users just sign into their favourite Web applications as usual, without anything getting in their way.
4. When users close the browser, Webconverger will erase all private data to ensure you are _really_ signed out.
