Default (free of charge) versions of Webconverger aren't packed with too many features. Webconverger is designed to be **fast**. 

So many of these features are **optional** and some will not work until enabled in a [customized](http://webconverger.com/buy/) build.

* [Firefox Web browser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox) 2.x rebuild [Iceweasel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceweasel) by default in every Webconverger. [Opera](http://download.webconverger.com/opera/) instead is optional, though unsupported.
* Automatic update on bootup - Webconverger is designed by default to **always be up to date**
* [[Printing]] disabled by default. cups must be re-enabled in the package list.
* Kiosk reset with `kioskresetstation=<mins>`. Resets browser after user defined minutes of idleness/inactivity. Default off.
* `toram` - loads live image into memory, so you can reuse media to boot further machines. Disabled by default as it makes startup a little slower.
* [[i18n]] support with keyboard switching via scim.
* [[Networking]] configuration with `ip=if,add,netm,gatew`. Default is DHCP.
* [[Adobe]] Flash is **enabled by default**. However there is a supported "fully free" version of Webconverger which does not have the Flash package.
* PDF viewer - xpdf - enabled by default
* xvideomode=800x600 (new in >=2.16) - override resolution to 800x600. Default display is *autodetected*. 
* Wireless customization support available. Not by default.
* Basic pornography text content [[Filtering]]
* Java support - disabled by default

Pressing F4 on initial Webconverger bootup can display further SPECIAL BOOT PARAMETERS documentation.

[Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt](http://www.google.com/search?q=kernel-parameters.txt) has some other arguments you can pass to the linux kernel. Such as `noacpi` which disables power management, which some old buggy BIOSs can be incompatible with.

From 2.16 Webconverger will have migrated from casper to live-initramfs. Documentation work is yet to begin, though for testers, [the live script](http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/debian-live/dists/trunk/live-initramfs/scripts/live?op=file&rev=0&sc=0) can offer very good clues about some *boot options* to try.
