[Customize Webconverger](http://webconverger.com/buy/) for your own homepage
like banks, museums, car dealerships, libraries and many other customers have
done. Most customers just want their [[homepage]] customised, however there are
further options:


* [[ISO]] (with [[grub|boot]]) and/or [[USB]] image varieties for [download](http://download.webconverger.com/)
* It's best to use a Live CD or USB, though we can arrange to install Webconverger to a hard drive
* Latest [Firefox Web browser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox) rebuild [Iceweasel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceweasel) by default in every Webconverger.
* custom [[Artwork]] - your $HOMEPAGE/bg.png, default being [http://portal.webconverger.com/bg.png](http://portal.webconverger.com/bg.png).
* [[Kiosk_reset|blanking]] **timeout** with `kioskresetstation=<mins>`. Resets browser after user defined minutes of idleness/inactivity.
* [[Networking]] customisation. Default is **wired** DHCP. Wireless works too!
* [[Adobe]] (Macromedia) Flash & [PDF viewing](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/3825411003/)
* [[Extensive_internationalization_support|i18n]] -  Exotic locales such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) are supported. CJK keyboard switching via [scim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCIM) and many other types of keyboard setups, such as Swiss German. Spelling support with dictionaries in many languages. [[maxi]] only.
* [[Printing]] support is included by default

# Extras for [customization](http://webconverger.com/buy/)

* Different layouts of the browser, such as disabling address bar and [[digital_signage_modes|kiosk]]
* Screen [[blanking]] options and setting the resolution to a fixed sized (displays are autodetected by default)
* Locking down the bootloader so [[boot]] options cannot be altered by users on machine boot
