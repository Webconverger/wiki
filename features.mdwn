[Customize Webconverger](http://webconverger.com/buy/) for your own homepage like banks, museums, car dealerships and many other customers have done. Most customers just need their [[homepage]] customised, however there are further options:


1. [[ISO]], [[USB]] or NETBOOT image varieties. Default: [[ISO]] for CDs

* [[Extensive_internationalization_support|i18n]] -  Exotic locales such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) are supported. CJK keyboard switching via [scim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCIM) and many other types of keyboard setups, such as swiss German

* Spelling support with dictionaries in many languages

* [Firefox Web browser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox) 2.x rebuild [Iceweasel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceweasel) by default in every Webconverger. [Opera](http://download.webconverger.com/opera/) is optional, though unsupported.

* Automatic update on bootup - Webconverger has an [[upgrade]] feature enabled by default

* [[Printing]]

* Kiosk reset with `kioskresetstation=<mins>`. Resets browser after user defined minutes of idleness/inactivity. Default off. (requires xautolock package)

* `toram` - loads live image into memory, so you can reuse media to boot further machines. Disabled by default as it makes startup slower.

* [[Networking]] customisation. Default is DHCP. Wireless network device support available, though not by default.

* [[Adobe]] (Macromedia) Flash is **enabled by default**.

* [PDF viewing](http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/851173358/) - [xpdf](http://packages.qa.debian.org/x/xpdf.html) - enabled by default

* Video mode override with `xvideomode=800x600` (new in >=2.16) - should override resolution to 800x600. Default display is *autodetected*.

* [[Filtering]]

* [[Digital_signage_modes|kiosk]]

* Remote desktop via VNC so one could control a [Digital Signage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signage) remotely. By default disabled.

* [[Artwork]] - your $HOMEPAGE/bg.png, default being [http://portal.webconverger.com/bg.png](http://portal.webconverger.com/bg.png).

* [Web boot](http://blog.daniel-baumann.ch/2007/09/07#20070907_debian-live-web-boot) option allowed from versions equal and greater than 2.30.

* Choice between syslinux and grub. Grub is more versatile, however it does not work on older hardware and it does not work with USB sticks. Default: Grub on ISOs from 2.30, else syslinux.
