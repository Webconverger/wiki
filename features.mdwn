So many of these features are **optional** and some will not work until enabled in a [customized](http://webconverger.com/buy/) build.

The default homepage on Webconverger builds are [http://portal.webconverger.com/](http://portal.webconverger.com/). [Customize Webconverger](http://webconverger.com/buy/) for your own homepage like banks, museums, car dealerships and many other customers have done.

# Upcoming features

Also see the infamous [TODO list](http://svn.webconverger.org/webconverger.org/TODO) and development progress with the [Changelog](http://svn.webconverger.org/webconverger.org/Changelog).

* Hard drive install - *BETA*

If you are interested in fast boot times, installing Webconverger on a hard disk is the best way of achieving this. This feature is currently in testing. You can **experiment** with the `install` boot parameter.
