[Customize Webconverger](http://webconverger.com/buy/) for your own homepage like banks, museums, car dealerships and many other customers have done. Most customers just need their [[homepage]] customised, however there are further options:


1. [[Extensive_internationalization_support|i18n]] -  Exotic locales such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) are supported. CJK keyboard switching via [scim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCIM) and many other types of keyboard setups, such as swiss German
2. Spelling support with dictionaries in many languages are available. 
3. [Firefox Web browser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox) 2.x rebuild [Iceweasel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceweasel) by default in every Webconverger. [Opera](http://download.webconverger.com/opera/) is optional, though unsupported.
4. Automatic update on bootup - Webconverger has an [[upgrade]] feature enabled by default
5. [[Printing]]
6. Kiosk reset with `kioskresetstation=<mins>`. Resets browser after user defined minutes of idleness/inactivity. Default off. (requires xautolock package)
7. `toram` - loads live image into memory, so you can reuse media to boot further machines. Disabled by default as it makes startup slower.
