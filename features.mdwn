* Latest [Firefox Web browser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox) with [HTML5 webm video](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Media_formats_supported_by_the_audio_and_video_elements)
* Custom [[background|artwork]] seen between sessions
* [[Kiosk_reset|blanking]] **timeout** with `kioskresetstation=<mins>`. Resets browser after user defined minutes of idleness/inactivity.
* [[Network_printing|printing]]
* [[Networking]] **wired** works simply with DHCP. [[Wireless]] works too!
* [[Adobe]] Flash & [PDF viewing](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/3825411003/)
* [[Extensive_internationalization_support|i18n]] -  Many types of keyboard setups, such as Swiss German. Spelling support with dictionaries in many languages.
