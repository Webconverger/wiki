[Customize Webconverger](http://webconverger.com/buy/) for your own homepage
like banks, museums, car dealerships, libraries and many other customers have
done. Most customers just want their [[homepage]] customised, however there are
further options:

* A choice of [[kiosk]] browser chrome, which helps limit Webconverger to the your customised homepage:
* [[ISO]]-hybrid image for burning to a CD or USB stick
* Latest [Firefox Web browser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox) by default in every Webconverger.
* custom [[Artwork]] - your $HOMEPAGE/bg.png
* [[Kiosk_reset|blanking]] **timeout** with `kioskresetstation=<mins>`. Resets browser after user defined minutes of idleness/inactivity.
* [[Networking]] **wired** works simply with DHCP. [[Wireless]] works too!
* [[Adobe]] Flash & [PDF viewing](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/3825411003/)
* [[Extensive_internationalization_support|i18n]] -  Exotic locales such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) are supported. CJK keyboard switching via [scim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCIM) and many other types of keyboard setups, such as Swiss German. Spelling support with dictionaries in many languages.
* Screen [[blanking]] options and setting the resolution to a fixed sized (displays are autodetected by default)
* [[Locking down the bootloader|blog/entry/cmdline_lock_down]] so [[boot]] options cannot be altered by users on machine boot
