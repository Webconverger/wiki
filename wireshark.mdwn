[[!meta title="How to packet sniff Webconverger"]]

Tools:

* [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) for running Webconverger on your host system as a guest
* [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) for packet sniffing

Tested in Windows. Unfortunately Virtualbox bridged networking under Linux tends to be broken.

* `noping` disables the [machine ping for statistics](http://ping.webconverger.org/) as documented in [[privacy]]
* `noconfig` disables the [configuration service](https://config.webconverger.com/)

# Virtualbox settings

Using **bridged networking** (it's NAT by default) and filter in Wireshark on the eth.src address of your guest.
