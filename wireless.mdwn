# Wireless (working from version 4!)

	wlan=essid,key

Examples:

To join a WPA network with ESSID 'foo' and password 'francisco' append `wlan=foo,francisco`

To join an unsecured network called 'w', append `wlan=w,`

To join any open network, append `wlan=,` to the [[boot]] options. This relies
on some wpa-supplicant magic that needs [[testing]]. If you do join an
unsecured wireless network, do remember you have **little security** until you
connect with **https**/SSL !!

# PLEASE BUY LINUX COMPATIBLE WIRELESS HARDWARE !!!

* [List of Linux compatible WLAN hardware](http://linux-wless.passys.nl/)

Please purchase [Linux compatible wireless hardware](http://www.linuxemporium.co.uk/products/wireless/). Else making your wireless work with Webconverger will be **very** difficult!

Other wireless chipsets known to work:

* most intel based cards
* most [atheros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheros) based cards
* ipw3945
* ipw2200
* ipw2100
* rt2x00
* rt2570

Wireless devices that require Window's drivers wrappers such as ndiswrapper or fw-cutter etc. are **too painful** to integrate with Webconverger. In many cases it simply cannot be done without actually having the device and preparing 'one off' packages.

## Getting a Windows wireless device working (for developers!)

This is a developer reference.

Get the Win32 drivers:

    x40:~/webc/wifi% ls
    ar5523.bin  ar5523.sys  net5523.cat  net5523.inf

Prime your chroot:

    sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper-common ndiswrapper-utils ndiswrapper-source

Build the ndiswrapper module for your distribution and architecture:

    m-a prepare
    m-a a-i ndiswrapper

With any luck, you'll have made a Debian package, like:

	/usr/src/ndiswrapper-modules-2.6.22-2-686_1.47-2+2.6.22-4_i386.deb

Install that package. You want that in your `config/chroot_local-packages`.

Configure your (chroot) system for the device

    sudo ndiswrapper -i net5523.inf
    sudo ndiswrapper -l
    sudo ndiswrapper -m

# Wireless router (recommended)

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/1172361934/" title="Every home should have a WRT54G-L by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1055/1172361934_fe1a77dc72_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="Every home should have a WRT54G-L" /></a>

A [Linksys WRT54G](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WRT54G) in **Wireless Client
mode** is a very good solution for wireless kiosk access. They are about 50USD
and this dedicated hardware provides excellent Wireless access without the
complication of often proprietary Wireless drivers for each client. The highly
recommended Linksys WRT54G allows at least four machines to easily plug into
the router.
