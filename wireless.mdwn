# Wireless

Note only the subscribed "install version" of Webconverger can persistently
keep your wireless configuration between reboots.

Wireless setup works by [directly mapping
wpa](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc/wireless)
[[boot]] configuration names onto [wpasupplicant for
Debian](http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/pkg-wpa/wpasupplicant/trunk/debian/README.Debian?view=markup).

### Example 0, essid 'home' with no security

Simply appending `wpa-ssid=home wpa-key-mgmt=NONE` to your [[boot]] command
line should set your machine up for these wireless settings.

### Example 1, hidden essid 'home', no/disabled security

Appending `wpa-ssid=home wpa-key-mgmt=NONE wpa-ap-scan=1 wpa-scan-ssid=1` will create the following configuration in [/etc/network/interfaces](https://github.com/Webconverger/Debian-Live-config/blob/master/webconverger/config/includes.chroot/etc/network/interfaces).

	iface wlan0 inet dhcp
		   pre-up iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.conf
		   wpa-driver wext
		   wpa-ssid home
		   wpa-key-mgmt NONE
		   wpa-ap-scan 1
		   wpa-scan-ssid 1

WARNING: Hidden essids are trivially detected with tools like [Wifi
Analyzer](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer).
Setup your Access Point to use WPA please.

### Example 2, broadcasting essid 'home', with WEP HEX key BBE54998315E7E1616B8462B45

Append `wpa-ssid=home wpa-key-mgmt=NONE wpa-wep-key0=BBE54998315E7E1616B8462B45`

WARNING: WEP is deprecated and insecure technology. Please use WPA instead.

### Example 3, broadcasting essid 'home', with WPA key uiopzxcv

Append `wpa-ssid=home wpa-psk=uiopzxcv`

### Example 4 "Spaces in the ESSID", broadcasting essid 'Hopstock Gjestenett', with WPA key uiopzxcv

Please avoid spaces in ESSIDs. In this case we workaround with a `encodeURI('Hopstock
Gjestenett')`, to get the following [[boot]] recipe:

	wpa-ssid=Hopstock%20Gjestenett wpa-psk=uiopzxcv

# Wireless router (recommended)

<http://www.tp-link.com> make some excellent products like the TL-WR1043ND.
[Ubiquiti Networks](http://www.ubnt.com/) also make some fantastic Wifi kit.

A [Linksys WRT54G](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WRT54G) in **Wireless Client
mode** is a very good solution for wireless kiosk access. They are about 50USD
and this dedicated hardware provides excellent Wireless access without the
complication of often proprietary Wireless drivers for each client. The highly
recommended Linksys WRT54G allows at least four machines to easily plug into
the router.
