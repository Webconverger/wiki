[[!meta title="Webconverger API documentation"]]

Webconverger heavily uses the notion of `/proc/cmdline` to control setup.
[Spaces in cmdline
values](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/993452/splitting-proc-cmdline-arguments-with-spaces)
need to be `encodeURI` in order not be considered keys themselves. For
developers, [[startup]] might better explain how these are used.

There are two ways to start using the API, firstly by hitting
[TAB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_key) on the boot screen. See [[testing]]
for a video of how to do this in a Virtual machine.

<img src="/img/webc-boot.png" alt="Syslinux boot menu, press TAB" />

Or by using the [configuration service](http://config.webconverger.com/) form
which you need to take a subscription out with Webconverger. The service
presents the various options below in a friendly Web form on boot, which are
saved on the Web so your values are retained between boots once subscribed.

### Your own homepage

Edit `homepage=`

You can enter several homepages, which will open in several tabs, separate each
address with `%20` e.g.
`homepage=http://portal.webconverger.com/%20http://webconverger.com`

##### Expansions

* MACID expands to your network [MAC address](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address)
* USBID expands to USB serial, for identifying which USB stick was booted - you could conceivably use different USB sticks for a lightweight (but not secure) physical authentication, `USBID_override=` is a way to override this value.
* WEBCID expands to <a href="https://config.webconverger.com/faq/#how-do-i-identify-my-machine(s)">Webconverger's identifier</a>
* WEBCVERSION expands to use `git describe` the running instance's version

For example: Customers want to track which kiosks are logging in.
These is best accomplished using a keyword **MACID**. For example the homepage:

	homepage=http://webconverger.com/?mac=MACID

Could be expanded to

	homepage=http://webconverger.com/?mac=081196ae2d3c

### Instantupdate to the homepage

Using `instantupdate` from version 28.

This [video has an instantupdate
demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJehjCZg02k). Good for getting a
pool of Webconverger devices on the same page. Support by the [[rpi2]] & x86
version currently. Android coming soon.

### Changing [[browser_chrome|kiosk]]

<https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/tree/master/etc/webc/extensions>

* chrome=webconverger - this is the default
* chrome=webcnoaddressbar - disable URL bar and search bar, good for [[controlled_access_setups|filtering]]
* chrome=webcfullscreen - fullscreen without any chrome
* chrome=neon - fullscreen as used with [Neon](http://neon.webconverger.com)
* chrome=debug - nightly testing tools, for [[testing]] crash recovery etc. and to expose `about:config`

See [[kiosk]] for screenshots of the options.

### [Neon](http://neon.webconverger.com/) configuration example (a complex example)

	chrome=neon
	homepage=http://iframereload.dabase.com//?mac=MACID
	timezone=Asia/Singapore
	cron=00%2003%20*%20*%20*%20root%20killall%20firefox
	hidecursor
	noblank
	xrandr-all=--rotate%20left

Explanation of the above:

1. Set the chrome (not the browser, but the [GUI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)), to a dark themed "neon" for <abbr="Digital Out Of Home">DOOH</abbr>
* Set the homepage to http://iframereload.dabase.com/, whilst also passing a screen identifier (mac address)
* Set the timezone to Singapore, so we can express a local time in the next line
* [[Schedule a job|cronjob]] to run at 3AM, to kill firefox, the browser used in Webconverger. This is to ensure responsiveness in case there is a memory leak
* `hidecursor` makes sure the mouse cursor is invisible
* `noblank` ensures the screen does not turn black, i.e. it's always showing the rendered Web page
* Rotate connected screens to portrait

### How to limit access with a blacklist or a whitelist?

Please see [[filtering]] page.

### Use Webconverger in a different language to English

Please refer to [[i18n]]

### Is it possible to change desktop background image ?

Please see [[artwork]] for details how to use `bgurl=`

### Specify a HTTP proxy at 192.168.1.5 with port 8888

append `http_proxy=http://192.168.1.5:8888`

[**NEW** in version 26](https://twitter.com/webconverger/status/510257858986799105): Basic authentication `http_proxy=http://user:pass@proxy:3128`

### How do I make the screen not timeout and go black?

Append `noblank`, see [[blanking]] for more.

### How do I make the terminal reset / timeout after being used?

Use `kioskresetstation`, see [[blanking]] for more information

### How do I prevent Webconverger from cleaning up after each session? (From 14.0)

Add `noclean`. This is **not recommended** for deployments, however if some
cases where the machine is used by just one person, this is very convenient for
day to day usage.

### Rotate the screen?

To rotate right on all connected screens:

	xrandr-all=--rotate%20right

This is [computed](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/home/webc/webc.sh#L74) as running `xrandr --output CONNECTED_DEVICE --rotate right`.

For finer control by explicitly naming your CONNECTED_DEVICE, you can use
`xrandr=`, but then you must discover the exact name of your output device,
which can vary machine to machine.

[Video explaining how to use debug mode to discover the properties of your connected displays](http://r2d2.webconverger.org/2012-11-13/xrandr.mp4)

### Need to setup up a higher than detected resolution?

Please follow this [[display]] guide.

### DEBUG MODE for developers

Append `debug`.

Once Webconverger is booted, the [dwm window
manager](http://dwm.suckless.org/tutorial) defaults to shift+alt+enter for a
Terminal. Gain root with `sudo -i`.

Please see [[debug]] for more.

### Position mouse pointer

	swarp=0,0

Moves the mouse cursor to the top left of the screen. This is useful when the
default cursor in the middle of the screen might accidentally trigger some
mouse over event in the Web application.

### Disable automatic upgrades with git

Append `noupgrade`. See [[upgrade]] for more details.

### Disable configuration service

Append `noconfig`

### How do I make the machine turn off at a set time everyday?

Set a [[cronjob]]

### Changing DNS or statically configuring the network?

Please refer to [[networking]]

### Locking down boot

Use `noescape`, which disallows [[debugging|debug]] of installed Webconverger.
However it only kicks in after the boot configuration is rewritten after a
successful upgrade.

### Hiding and showing the cursor

Hiding the cursor is often used with touch screens:

	hidecursor

Caveat: Since
[hidecursor](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/home/webc/.xserverrc)
can only be applied when starting X, you cannot use this option in the [Live
mode](https://config.webconverger.com/faq/#what-do-you-mean-by-live-version-and-install-version)
with the [configuration service](http://config.webconverger.com/).

Showing:

	showcursor

By default the cursor is shown on input use and hides after 5 seconds. See [[blanking]] for details.

### How to create a screensaver for attracting patrons?

Please see [screensaver](/screensaver/).

### Touch screen input calibration and user interface tweaks

Please refer to the [[touch_screen_calibration]] wiki page for calibration and UI tweaks like `widescrollbars` and `grabdrag`.

### How do I declare my network printer?

Using the `printer=` API, documented in [[printing]].

### How do I show a print button?

	showprintbutton

### How do I enable the numlock for numpad text entry?

Use `numlock`.

### How to override Firefox preferences (autoconfig)

`prefs=` sets Firefox's **powerful** `autoadmin.global_config_url`
[autoconfig](http://mike.kaply.com/2012/03/16/customizing-firefox-autoconfig-files/)
feature.

Examples:

* prefs=http://prefs.webconverger.com/2015/safe.js - force Google to provide a safe search result
* prefs=http://prefs.webconverger.com/2015/chromebook.js - override user agent string
* prefs=http://prefs.webconverger.com/2015/click-to-play.js - Opt into [[flash|adobe]]
* prefs=http://prefs.webconverger.com/2015/disable-safebrowsing.js - Disable Google's safe browsing

Please look for further usage examples in [[printing]] and
[[allowing_popups|blog/entry/Popups_and_SSL_warnings]].

### customer= API

Stanza for you to indicate your **current email address**, so we can
contact you in the case your configuration id becomes unclear.

Ignored by Webconverger OS itself.

### Remote logging (from version 15)

Sign up for an account with [Papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com/?thank=97e900)

	log=logs.papertrailapp.com:XXXXX

Replace XXXXX with the port number associated with your account.

Alternatively, you can use the `support` command to send us your logs to the
**http://support.webconverger.com/** service available from the information
icon next to your alias in the configuration panel.

### Wireless configuration

Although wired connections are preferred, Webconverger does have
comprehensive [[support_for_wireless_devices|wireless]] and
[[blog/entry/USB_tethering]].

### Switch between tabs

	tabswitch=5

Switch between tabs on chrome={neon,webcfullscreen} every 5 seconds.

Screencast: <http://youtu.be/eh6u6Bmjnu8>

### Can I turn off the Webconverger brand mark?

Please see [[artwork]].

# Hiding the cursor

Add to your configuration:

	hidecursor

# Adjusting the volume to 100%

We do set [volume to 100% by
default](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc/wireless#L20)
however sometimes it might need tweaking, for example:

	amixer=sset%20Master%20100%25

# Tweaking the touch pad

We have an interface on synclient

	synclient=TapButton1%3D1
