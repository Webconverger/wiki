## Packages


* [stable](http://webconverger.com/debian/stable/)

There is an unstable branch, however most work is happening in stable atm. Unstable will be used more when the product is more mature, for testing purposes much like Debian.

## Building the image with live-helper

The most important elements of building Webconverger is the package list and setting `LIVE_BOOTAPPEND`.

* [Package list](http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/debian-live/configs/webc/webconverger/config/chroot_local-packageslists/?rev=0&sc=0)
* [LIVE_BOOTAPPEND in /config/binary](http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/debian-live/configs/webc/webconverger/config/binary?op=file&rev=0&sc=0)

Develop on a Debian system:

 * apt-get install [live-helper](http://live.debian.net/) (deb http://live.debian.net/debian etch main)
 * svn co svn://svn.debian.org/svn/debian-live/configs/webc
 * webconverger/ is the base config file. Poke around.
 * Take a look inside config/. You probably need to edit LIVE_MIRROR variables in the file bootstrap.
 * lh_build in webconverger/ not /config !

Please [contact hendry](http://hendry.iki.fi/) if you have any suggestions/comments/fixes/patches. :)

 * Read [Testing setup guide](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive/Howto/Creating_a_Test_environment)
 * Join the [Debian Live](http://debian-live.alioth.debian.org/) community

Tips:


 * squid or [apt-cacher](http://packages.qa.debian.org/a/apt-cacher.html) saves bandwidth


## Customizing service

I hope to make some money by offering a build service of the above at [Webconverger.com/buy](http://webconverger.com/buy/). You're free to build your own Webconverger image, though please do not abuse bandwidth of my repos. Also please let me know if you can it's application for the [[Testimonials|press]] page.

So I am happy if you're competent enough to make your own [Web operating system](http://natalian.org/archives/2007/05/23/web-operating-systems/).
Though if you need support services et al, it's best to get me to do it. I'm cheap and I know the code best. ;) 

Spread the word, the Web is **the** open computing API for all.
