If you are new to the project, **Welcome**!! Please start out by [[testing]]. Thank you!

<div class="notebox"> The Webconverger distribution is <a
href="http://src.webconverger.com/">opensource</a> (notable exceptions are
non-free wireless firmware and [[flash|adobe]]). You <b>must</b> understand
that the branding (logo and the name "Webconverger") are <b>proprietary</b>.
Only Webconverger built images should display the logo and can be sold as
"Webconverger". Thank you.</div>

## Building on a Debian system:

Building an image from scratch is usually only necessary if you need to
customise the image's packages. The [[boot_API|boot]] should be sufficient for
most of your needs.

This is the developer supported way of building the Webconverger image.
**Please do not ask** [webc-users](http://config.webconverger.com) how to
customise Webconverger any other way to avoid paying for the [configuration
service](http://config.webconverger.com) that funds this project. Thank you!

1. Download and install the **latest**
[live-build](http://packages.qa.debian.org/l/live-build.html) from the [Debian
Unstable repository](http://packages.qa.debian.org/l/live-build.html).

1. `git clone git://github.com/Webconverger/Debian-Live-config.git`
1. `cd Debian-Live-config/webconverger/`
1. Take a long good look at [auto/config](https://github.com/Webconverger/Debian-Live-config/blob/master/webconverger/auto/config)
1. `make`

These steps are formalised in the daily build process's [build.sh](https://github.com/Webconverger/dailybuild/blob/master/build.sh).

It is recommend you build from a [[chroot]] and invest some time to setup your development environment.

Next use this [[testing_guide|testing]] on your freshly built image.

Please share your forks on github! :)

## If your build doesn't work

* Check with the latest [daily build](http://build.webconverger.org/) logs. Compare them.
* Check for bugs with [Debian Live](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?repeatmerged=no&src=live-build)
* [Submit a bug report](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/issues)

## Debugging mode with the built Webconverger image

Debugging in Webconverger simply involves appending `debug` to the [[boot]]
options. The window manager is [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/tutorial).
