## Packages


* [stable](http://webconverger.com/debian/stable/)

There is an unstable branch, however most work is happening in stable atm. Unstable will be used more when the product is more mature, for testing purposes much like Debian.

## Building the image with live-helper

The most important elements of building Webconverger are:

1. [The package lists](http://git.debian.org/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=tree;f=webconverger/config/chroot_local-packageslists)
2. [LH_BOOTAPPEND in config/binary](http://git.debian.org/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=blob;f=webconverger/config/binary)

[live-initramfs lists the parameters](http://git.debian.org/?p=users/daniel/live-initramfs.git;a=blob;f=manpages/live-initramfs.en.7.txt;)


## Step by step, developing on a Debian system:

 * apt-get install [live-helper](http://live.debian.net/) from unstable
 * `git clone git://git.debian.org/git/debian-live/config-webc.git`
 * webconverger/ is the base config file. Poke around.
 * Take a look inside config/. You probably need to edit LIVE_MIRROR variables in the file bootstrap.
 * lh_build in webconverger/ not config/ !

Please [contact hendry](http://hendry.iki.fi/) if you have any suggestions/comments/fixes/patches. :)

 * Read [Testing setup guide](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive/Howto/Creating_a_Test_environment)
 * Join the [Debian Live](http://debian-live.alioth.debian.org/) community. See the [dev mailing list archives](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/debian-live-devel/)

Tips:


 * squid or [apt-cacher](http://packages.qa.debian.org/a/apt-cacher.html) saves bandwidth whilst Debian Live's live-helper downloads the packages


## Customizing service

I hope to make some money by offering a build service of the above at [Webconverger.com/buy](http://webconverger.com/buy/). You're free to build your own Webconverger image. Please let me know if you can it's application for the [[Testimonials|press]] page.

So I am happy if you're competent enough to make your own [Web operating system](http://natalian.org/archives/2007/05/23/web-operating-systems/).
Though if you need support services et al, it's best to get me to do it. ;) 

Spread the word, the Web is **the** open computing API for all.
