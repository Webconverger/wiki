# Less is more

Webconverger's development mantra.

## Translations

The [Webconverger subversion repositry](http://svn.webconverger.org/) has files like


* [Portal src](http://svn.webconverger.org/portal.webconverger.com/index.php.en)

Which need to be translated to every locale imaginable. :)

Take a peek at:

* [[i18n]]
* [i18n downloads](http://download.webconverger.com/i18n)

Thank you very much for any translation help. If your translation meets my quality standards, you could be [famous](http://webconverger.infogami.com/Acknowledgements)!

## Design

If you are a artist/"Web designer" who knows how to write [standards compliant](http://whatwg.org), minimal, device independent CSS (like mine, but better looking) without going too crazy with PNGs, then I'm interested in reaching out to you. My visual design skills on http://webconverger.com/ are pitiful. Can you tell?

## Firefox extension writers

You could write stuff on any platform. I need to get [includes stuff](http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/debian-live/configs/webconverger/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/iceweasel/?rev=0&sc=0) into the extension.

* [[Kiosk]]

There is lots of room for movement here, as long as your extension is **fast**.

## Hacking and building the image

The most important elements of building Webconverger is the package list and setting `LIVE_BOOTAPPEND`.

* [Package list](http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/debian-live/configs/webconverger/config/chroot_localpackageslists/webconverger?op=file&rev=0&sc=0)
* [LIVE_BOOTAPPEND in /config/binary](http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/debian-live/configs/webconverger/config/binary?op=file&rev=0&sc=0)

Develop on a debian etch system with [apt-cacher](http://packages.qa.debian.org/a/apt-cacher.html) (saves bandwidth!).

 * apt-get install [live-helper](http://live.debian.net/) (deb http://live.debian.net/debian etch main)
 * svn co svn://svn.debian.org/svn/debian-live/configs/
 * webconverger/ is the base config file. Poke around.
 * Take a look inside config/. You probably need to edit LIVE_MIRROR variables in the file bootstrap.
 * lh_build in webconverger/ not /config !

Please [contact hendry](http://hendry.iki.fi/) if you have any suggestions/comments/fixes/patches. :)

## Customizing service

I hope to make some money by offering a build service of the above at [Webconverger.com/buy](http://webconverger.com/buy/). You're free to build your own Webconverger image, though please do not abuse bandwidth on my repos.

So I am happy if you're competent enough to make your own [Web operating system](http://natalian.org/archives/2007/05/23/web-operating-systems/).
Though if you need support services et al, it's best to get me to do it. I'm ridiculously cheap and I know the code best. ;) 

Spread the word, the Web is **the** open computing API for all.
