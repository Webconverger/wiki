If you are new to the project, **Welcome**!! Please start out by [[testing]].

We like to think we are pretty innovative how we use [git](http://git-scm.com/)
for [[upgrades|upgrade]] and managing just about everything we do. :)

<div class="notebox"> The Webconverger distribution is <a
href="http://src.webconverger.com/">opensource</a> (notable exceptions are
non-free wireless firmware and [[flash|adobe]]). You <b>must</b> understand
that the branding (logo and the name "Webconverger") are <b>proprietary</b>.
Only Webconverger built images should display the logo and can be sold as
"Webconverger". Thank you.</div>

## Building on a Debian system:

Building an image from scratch is usually only necessary if you need to
customise the image's packages. The [[boot_API|boot]] should be sufficient for
most of your needs.

This is the developer supported way of building the Webconverger image.
**Please do not ask** [webc-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/webc-users) how to
customise Webconverger any other way to avoid paying for the [configuration
service](http://config.webconverger.com) that funds this project. Thank you!

1. Download [live-build](http://packages.qa.debian.org/l/live-build.html) 3.x from the [Debian
Unstable repository](http://packages.qa.debian.org/l/live-build.html), and syslinux.

1. `git clone git://github.com/Webconverger/Debian-Live-config.git`
1. `cd Debian-Live-config/webconverger/`
1. Take a long good look at [auto/config](https://github.com/Webconverger/Debian-Live-config/blob/master/webconverger/auto/config)
1. `make`

These steps are formalised in the [daily build](http://build.webconverger.org/)
process's
[webc-build.sh](https://github.com/Webconverger/dailybuild/blob/master/webc-build.sh).

Next use this [[testing_guide|testing]] on your freshly built image.

Please share your forks on github! :) Contributions must be [MIT

## Tips for getting your patch out

In debug mode:

	root@webconverger:/etc/systemd/system# git status | less
	root@webconverger:/etc/systemd/system# git commit
	[systemd fa18ba0] Upgrade service
	 create mode 120000 etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/upgrade.service
	 create mode 120000 etc/systemd/system/upgrade.service
	 create mode 100644 lib/systemd/system/upgrade.service
	root@webconverger:~# git format-patch HEAD~1
	0001-Upgrade-service.patch
	root@webconverger:~# cat 0001-Upgrade-service.patch | p
	http://ix.io/41O

And provide http://ix.io/41O in a bug report! :)

## If your build doesn't work

1. Check with the latest [daily build](http://build.webconverger.org/) logs. Compare them.
