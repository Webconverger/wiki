.ISO [downloadable](http://download.webconverger.com) files are ISO-hybrid
images to be copied onto a USB stick/key.

# How to copy the .iso file to a USB stick using Windows
Since version 6.1 webconverger provides a hybrid.iso which can be burned to CD or flashed on an usb-stick.
In some scenarios flashing the hybrid-iso onto an usb-stick with MS Windows won´t work out.

You can follow [the USB imaging guide from Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromImgFiles#Windows), from [ArchLinux](http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Install_from_a_USB_flash_drive), or follow the steps beneath. ([Roadkil's Disk Image](http://www.roadkil.net/program.php/P12/Disk%20Image) it is a more lightweight and flexible alternative to Win32 Disk Imager.)

1. Download [Win32 Disk Imager](https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer/+download) zip and unpack it.
1. Download the iso-file.
1. Start Win32DiskImager as administrator (right click …).
1. Select the iso-file as source (click the folder icon, and write *.iso in the path to be able to select the iso-file).
1. Select the USB-Stick as target device.
1. Click write.

# How to copy .iso to USB stick (under Linux):

`dmesg` or `fdisk -l` will list your inserted USB drive - usually /dev/sdx ("x" representing letter like sda, sdb etc.), double check with `dmesg`.

	dd if=webc-12.0.iso of=/dev/sdx

Detailed description on [Debian wiki](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive/Howto/USB).

* Just as fast as a hard drive in many cases
* USB boot works generally only with newer computers (since 2004)

Almost any cheap generic USB stick should be fine. Feel free to use the usb
image also with embedded boards and Compact Flash cards (they behave like
/dev/hda usually).

# Install the USB .iso to a hard drive

The same principle applies. You copy the "image" to you hard drive using `dd`.
In order to do this you typically need to put the USB version of Webconverger
into debug mode (remove `nosudo` from [[boot]]). Or boot with an Ubuntu Live CD
and image from there to your hard drive (typically `dd if=webc.iso
of=/dev/sda`). Apologies for not providing a GUI at this point in time.

# Booting your USB stick

Different machines have different ways of **Entering the BIOS boot menu**. However it's usually the [Esc], [F8] or [F12] key or at least configurable in the BIOS menu.
