.ISO [downloadable](http://download.webconverger.com) files are ISO-hybrid
images to be copied onto a USB stick/key.

# How to copy the .iso file to a USB stick using Microsoft Windows

After [downloading](http://download.webconverger.com/), you can follow [the USB
imaging guide from
Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromImgFiles#Windows) or
from
[ArchLinux](http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Install_from_a_USB_flash_drive).

# How to copy .iso to USB stick under Linux

`dmesg` or `fdisk -l` will list your inserted USB drive - usually /dev/sdx ("x"
representing letter like sdb, sdc etc.), double check with `dmesg`.

	sudo dd if=webc-12.0.iso of=/dev/sdx

Detailed description on [Debian wiki](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive/Howto/USB).

* Just as fast as a hard drive in many cases
* USB boot works generally only with newer computers (since 2004)

Almost any cheap generic USB stick should be fine. Feel free to use the usb
image also with embedded boards and Compact Flash cards (they behave like
/dev/hda usually).

# Install the USB .iso to a hard drive

The same principle under Linux applies. You copy the "image" to you hard drive
using `dd`.  In order to do this you typically need to put the USB version of
Webconverger into debug mode (remove `nosudo` from [[boot]]). Or boot with an
Ubuntu Live CD and image from there to your hard drive (typically `sudo dd
if=webc.iso of=/dev/sda`). Apologies for not providing a GUI at this point in
time. We are working on it!

# Booting your USB stick

Different machines have different ways of **Entering the BIOS boot menu**.
However it's usually the [Esc], [F8] or [F12] key or at least configurable in
the BIOS menu.
