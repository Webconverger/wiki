.img [downloadable](http://download.webconverger.com/) files are USB images to be copied onto a USB stick/key.

## How to copy .img to USB stick (under Windows):

As [described earlier on the forum](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/d0a2a310a0980078):

1. Insert a USB stick that you are willing to replace with Webconverger and note it's drive letter
* Download an [IMG](http://download.webconverger.com/mini.img), a Webconverger USB image to desktop
* Download the [experimental dd 0.6 beta 2](http://webconverger.com/dd.exe) to the desktop
* Start menu -> Run -> cmd (this launched the scary black console)
* `cd Desktop`
* `dd if=mini.img od=`**x**`:` (**x** representing your USB drive you are going to replace with Webconverger!)

## How to copy .img to USB stick (under Linux):

1. run root terminal (or normal terminal with "sudo su")
2. fdisk -l will list your USB drive - usually /dev/sdx ("x" representing letter like sda, sdb etc.), double check with `dmesg`
3. dd if=webconverger-image.img of=/dev/sdx

Detailed description on [Debian wiki](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive/Howto/USB).

* Works only with newer computers
* Just as fast as a hard drive in many cases

[Kingston DataTravelers](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/1172362068/) are recommended, though almost any generic USB stick should be fine. Feel free to use the usb image also with embedded boards and Compact Flash cards (they behave like /dev/hda usually).

# Appending arguments to boot loader

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2366474295/" title="French support added to USB boot by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2110/2366474295_c089249bd5_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="French support added to USB boot" /></a>

When the bootloader (syslinux) initially loads, you'll have a few seconds to
type in something at the toboot: prompt. For example to get boot [[maxi]] with
[[i18n]] French support simply add:

	live locale=fr

# Hacking the USB [[boot]]

Plug your Webconverger USB stick in and mount the USB stick, for e.g.:

	x61:~% sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb

Edit the menu.cfg. Alter elements like the [[homepage]].

	x61:/mnt/usb% sudo vim syslinux/menu.cfg

Unmount and boot up your system:

	x61:/mnt/usb% cd
	x61:~% sudo umount /mnt/usb

# Developer notes

In config/binary:

	LH_BINARY_IMAGES="usb-hdd"

And `grub` doesn't work, so you must use the `syslinux` bootloader.
