* Just as fast as a hard drive in many cases
* Does not touch any existing disks on your computer when it Live boots so it's great for trialling. Remove thumb drive and the machine is back to how it was before
* USB boot works generally works with computers made since 2004

Almost any cheap generic USB stick greater than 0.5G should be fine.

# How to copy the ISO-hybrid file to a USB stick using Microsoft Windows

After [downloading](http://download.webconverger.com/), you can follow [the USB
imaging guide from
Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromImgFiles#Windows) or
from
[ArchLinux](http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Install_from_a_USB_flash_drive).

The tool to use is called the [Win32 disk imager](https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer).

# How to copy the ISO-hybrid to a USB stick under Linux

`dmesg` or `fdisk -l` will list your inserted USB drive - usually /dev/sdx ("x"
representing letter like sdb, sdc etc.).

	sudo dd if=webc-12.0.iso of=/dev/sdx

You might find specifying the additional argument `bs=1M` makes it faster.

# From MacOSX

Please follow the [Ubuntu MacOSX imaging
guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromImgFiles#Mac_OS_X)
but your case the ".img file" looks something like `webc-12.0.iso` in your
Downloads directory.

# Configuring your PC to boot the USB key instead of your hard drive

Please don't be daunted by adjusting the boot order of your machine. You are
exercising your consumer choice, however this isn't straightforward as
practically every software preloaded into a PC (the BIOS) is
different!

There are different keys of entering the BIOS boot menu depending on the BIOS,
it could be [Del], [Esc], [F2], [F8] or [F12] key. The BIOS usually flashes
which key to press on your keyboard that allows you to access the BIOS setup
for the briefest of moments as you turn your PC computer on.

Once you are in the BIOS menu, you need to find the boot menu and bubble up the
USB disk where you copied Webconverger upon. Then Save & Exit, to boot
Webconverger every time you power on that machine.

If you managed to configure your BIOS, please post pictures of your particular
BIOS using the [webcboot tag](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/webcboot/) on
Flickr. Thank you!
