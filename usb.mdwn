* Just as fast as a hard drive in many cases
* Does not touch any existing disks on your computer when it Live boots so it's great for trialling. Remove thumb drive and the machine is back to how it was before
* USB boot works generally works with computers made since 2004

Any generic USB stick greater than 0.5G should be fine.  Alternatively you can
order a preloaded [Webconverger stick at
OSDisc](http://www.osdisc.com/cgi-bin/view.cgi/products/linux/webconverger).

1. Download the latest official Webconverger from
<http://dl.webconverger.com/latest.iso> The download file will be renamed to
the latest ISO, at the time of writing webc-13.0.iso.

2. Download Disk Imager from
<https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer/+download> (download binary version,
not source version) It should download as a zip file. Extract all files to
desired location

3. Insert your USB stick

4. Note the drive letter assigned to your USB stick

5. Start Disk Imager (from your folder of extracted files)

6. Select the downloaded file (webc-13.0.iso) and target device, and click
"Write" (Note: this will wipe all information you have on the selected device.
So be very careful to note the correct drive letter assigned to your USB stick
at step.4)

7. Remove your USB stick when the operation is complete

`dmesg` or `fdisk -l` will list your inserted USB drive - usually /dev/sdx ("x"
representing letter like sdb, sdc etc.).

	sudo dd if=webc-12.0.iso of=/dev/sdx

You might find specifying the additional argument `bs=1M` makes it faster.

Please don't be daunted by adjusting the boot order of your machine. You are
exercising your consumer choice, however this isn't straightforward as
practically every software preloaded into a PC (the BIOS) is
different!

There are different keys of entering the BIOS boot menu depending on the BIOS,
it could be [Del], [Esc], [F2], [F8] or [F12] key. The BIOS usually flashes
which key to press on your keyboard that allows you to access the BIOS setup
for the briefest of moments as you turn your PC computer on.

Once you are in the BIOS menu, you need to find the boot menu and bubble up the
USB disk where you copied Webconverger upon. Then Save & Exit, to boot
Webconverger every time you power on that machine.

If you managed to configure your BIOS, please post pictures of your particular
BIOS using the [webcboot tag](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/webcboot/) on
