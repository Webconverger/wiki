.img [downloadable](http://download.webconverger.com/) files are USB images to be copied onto a USB stick/key.

# How to copy .img to USB stick (under Windows):

Please follow this [USB imaging guide from Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromImgFiles#Windows) or this one from [ArchLinux](http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Install_from_a_USB_flash_drive).

# How to copy .img to USB stick (under Linux):

`fdisk -l` will list your USB drive - usually /dev/sdx ("x" representing letter like sda, sdb etc.), double check with `dmesg`.

	dd if=webconverger-image.img of=/dev/sdx

Detailed description on [Debian wiki](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive/Howto/USB).

* Just as fast as a hard drive in many cases
* USB boot works generally only with newer computers (since 2004)

Almost any cheap generic USB stick should be fine. Feel free to use the usb
image also with embedded boards and Compact Flash cards (they behave like
/dev/hda usually).

# Booting your USB stick

Different machines have different ways of **Entering the boot menu**. However it's usually the [Esc], [F8] or [F11] key or at least configurable in the BIOS menu.

# Appending arguments to boot loader

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2366474295/" title="French support added to USB boot by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2110/2366474295_c089249bd5_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="French support added to USB boot" /></a>

When the bootloader (syslinux) initially loads, you'll have a few seconds to
type in something at the toboot: prompt. For example to get boot with [[i18n]]
French support simply add:

	live locale=fr

# Hacking the USB [[boot]]

Plug your Webconverger USB stick in and mount the USB stick, for e.g.:

	x61:~% sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb

Edit the live.cfg. Alter elements like the [[homepage]].

	x61:/mnt/usb% sudo vim syslinux/live.cfg

Unmount and boot up your system:

	x61:/mnt/usb% cd
	x61:~% sudo umount /mnt/usb

You can edit the image without first flashing the physical drive using <http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive/Howto/USB> as a guide:

	sudo mount -o loop,offset=512 webconverger.2010-01-06.5.6-usb.img /mnt/myusb

And from there you would typically edit `sudo vim /mnt/myusb/syslinux/live.cfg` to remove **nosudo** for debugging.

# Developer notes

In config/binary:

	LH_BINARY_IMAGES="usb-hdd"

And `grub` does not work, so you must use the `syslinux` bootloader.

# Tests on various hardware

USB image boots work on most hardware nowadays.
