.ISO [downloadable](http://download.webconverger.com/) files are ISO-hybrid
images to be copied onto a USB
stick/key.

# How to copy the .iso file to a USB stick using Windows
Since version 6.1 webconverger provides a hybrid.iso which can be burned to CD or flashed on an usb-stick.
In some scenarios flashing the hybrid-iso onto an usb-stick with MS Windows won´t work out.

You can follow [the USB imaging guide from Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromImgFiles#Windows), from [ArchLinux](http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Install_from_a_USB_flash_drive), or follow the steps beneath. ([Roadkil's Disk Image](http://www.roadkil.net/program.php/P12/Disk%20Image) it is a more lightweight and flexible alternative to Win32 Disk Imager.)

1. Download [Win32 Disk Imager](https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer/+download) zip and unpack it.  
1. Download the iso-file.  
1. Start Win32DiskImager as administrator (right click …).  
1. Select the iso-file as source (click the folder icon, and write *.iso in the path to be able to select the iso-file).  
1. Select the USB-Stick as target device.  
1. Click write.  

# How to copy .iso to USB stick (under Linux):

`fdisk -l` will list your USB drive - usually /dev/sdx ("x" representing letter like sda, sdb etc.), double check with `dmesg`.

	dd if=webc-6.2.iso of=/dev/sdx

Detailed description on [Debian wiki](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive/Howto/USB).

* Just as fast as a hard drive in many cases
* USB boot works generally only with newer computers (since 2004)

Almost any cheap generic USB stick should be fine. Feel free to use the usb
image also with embedded boards and Compact Flash cards (they behave like
/dev/hda usually).

# Install the USB .iso to a hard drive

The same principle applies. You copy the "image" to you hard drive using `dd`.
In order to do this you typically need to put the USB version of Webconverger
into debug mode (remove `nosudo` from [[boot]]). Or boot with an Ubuntu Live CD
and image from there to your hard drive (typically `dd if=webc.iso
of=/dev/sda`). Apologies for not providing a GUI at this point in time.

# Booting your USB stick

Different machines have different ways of **Entering the boot menu**. However it's usually the [Esc], [F8] or [F11] key or at least configurable in the BIOS menu.

# Appending arguments to boot loader

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2366474295/" title="French support added to USB boot by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2110/2366474295_c089249bd5_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="French support added to USB boot" /></a>

When the [[bootloader|boot]] initially loads, you'll have a few seconds to
type in something at the toboot: prompt. For example to get boot with [[i18n]]
French support simply add:

	live locale=fr

# Hacking the USB [[boot]]
The reason why [Webconverger has a commercial customisation
service](http://webconverger.com/buy) is that it used to be very difficult to
make trivial changes to the [[boot_command_line|boot]].

The iso-hybrid format used on the newer releases makes the file system on your USB install read only, and is thus more cumbersome to modify. If you make your own build you can make it in the .img format which leaves the file system writable. This section has two parts, the first about modifying the standard iso-hybrid, the other about modifying the .img format.

## Customising [iso-hybrid](http://git.debian-maintainers.org/?p=syslinux/syslinux.git;a=blob;f=doc/isolinux.txt#l80)

The customisation steps are something like:

	mount -o loop webc-8.iso /mnt/webc/
	rsync -av /mnt/webc/ /mnt/custom/
	chmod +w /mnt/custom/isolinux/live.cfg

Now edit `/mnt/custom/isolinux/live.cfg` and change the [[boot]] command line
with your homepage URL.

Now rebuild the ISO like so:

	mkisofs -o /tmp/custom-webc.iso -b -r -J -l -cache-inodes -allow-multidot -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat /mnt/custom

Finally:

	/usr/bin/isohybrid /tmp/custom-webc.iso

`isohybrid` comes from a recent version of [syslinux](http://packages.debian.org/unstable/syslinux-common)

The [customisation service](http://webconverger.com/buy) remains if you are unable to perform these commands.
It's also difficult to edit the package listing, such as changing [[chrome|kiosk]]
without the [service](http://webconverger.com/buy) still. For
[[large_deployments|press]], please enquire with sales in how we can help you.

## Customising .img-installs
This only works on a `lh config -b usb-hdd` type **.img**.

Plug your Webconverger USB stick in and mount the USB stick, for e.g.:

	x61:~% sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb

Edit the live.cfg. Alter elements like the [[homepage]].

	x61:/mnt/usb% sudo vim syslinux/live.cfg

Unmount and boot up your system:

	x61:/mnt/usb% cd
	x61:~% sudo umount /mnt/usb

# Disable boot menu entirely 
A common [customisation request](http://webconverger.com/buy/) is to disable
the [[boot_menu|boot]], in order to make this Web client tamper proof.

You can edit `isolinux/isolinux.cfg` on the USB image to look something like:
	
	default linux
	label linux
		kernel /live/vmlinuz1
		append initrd=/live/initrd1.img boot=live quiet homepage=http://portal.webconverger.com/ nonetworking splash vga=current username=webc hostname=webconverger union=aufs
