# How to copy the ISO-hybrid file to a USB stick using Microsoft Windows

After [downloading](http://download.webconverger.com/), you can follow [the USB
imaging guide from
Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromImgFiles#Windows) or
from
[ArchLinux](http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Install_from_a_USB_flash_drive).

# How to copy the ISO-hybrid to a USB stick under Linux

`dmesg` or `fdisk -l` will list your inserted USB drive - usually /dev/sdx ("x"
representing letter like sdb, sdc etc.), double check with `dmesg`.

	sudo dd if=webc-12.0.iso of=/dev/sdx

Detailed description on [Debian wiki](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive/Howto/USB).

* Just as fast as a hard drive in many cases
* USB boot works generally only with newer computers (since 2004)

Almost any cheap generic USB stick should be fine. Feel free to use the usb
image also with embedded boards and Compact Flash cards (they behave like
/dev/hda usually).

# Booting your USB stick

Different machines have different ways of **Entering the BIOS boot menu**.
However it's usually the [Esc], [F8] or [F12] key or at least configurable in
the BIOS menu.
