.img [downloadable](http://download.webconverger.com/) files are USB-hdd images for hardware able to boot from a USB stick/key.

## How to copy .img to USB stick (under Linux):
1. run root terminal (or normal terminal with "sudo su")
2. fdisk -l will list your USB drive - usually /dev/sdx ("x" representing letter like sda, sdb etc.)
3. dd if=webconverger-image.img of=/dev/sdx

Detailed description on [debain wiki](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive/Howto/USB). 

* Works only with newer computers
* Just as fast as a hard drive in many cases

[Kingston DataTravelers](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/1172362068/) are recommended, though almost any generic USB stick should be fine. Feel free to use the usb image also with embedded boards and Compact Flash cards (they behave like /dev/hda usually).
