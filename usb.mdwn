[[!meta title="Preparing a USB stick to boot Webconverger"]]

## Webconverger boots from a USB memory stick plugged into your PC

You may either [purchase a pre-installed memory
stick](https://www.osdisc.com/products/webconverger?affiliate=webconverger), or
you may create one yourself with any generic USB stick greater than 1G.

Instead of creating a USB stick for booting a PC to test Webconverger, you can
alternatively use [[Virtualbox|testing]].

Below are a series of step-by-step instructions to help you create a
Webconverger USB stick on popular operating systems.

# Using Microsoft Windows

1. Download the latest official Webconverger from
<http://dl.webconverger.com/latest.iso> The downloaded file will be renamed to
the latest ISO, webc-VERSION.iso
2. Download Disk Imager from
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/files/latest/download>
3. The 'win32diskimager' binary should download as a zip file. Extract all files to a folder on the Desktop
4. Insert your USB stick
5. Note the drive letter assigned to your USB stick
6. Start Disk Imager from your folder of extracted files on the Desktop
7. Select the downloaded file webc-VERSION.iso (you need to change the file filter to *.*) and target device, and click
"Write" (Note: this will wipe all information you have on the selected USB stick.
So be very careful to note the correct drive letter assigned to your USB stick
at step.4)
8. Remove your USB stick when the operation is complete

If you re-insert the USB key once specially formatted with Webconverger,
Windows may ask if it should format the USB stick. Ignore this, it's because
Windows doesn't understand the filesystem now on your USB stick.

# Using MacOSX

Please follow our step-by-step [[MacOSX_guide_with_pictures|macosx_usb]].

# Using Linux

`dmesg` or `fdisk -l` will list your inserted USB drive - usually /dev/sdx ("x"
representing letter like sdb, sdc etc.).

	sudo dd if=webc-VERSION.iso of=/dev/sdx

You might find specifying the additional argument `bs=1M` makes it faster.

## Configuring your PC to boot the USB key instead of your hard drive

Don't be daunted by adjusting the boot order of your machine. You are
exercising your consumer choice, however this isn't straightforward as
practically every software preloaded into a PC (the BIOS) is different!

There are different keys of entering the BIOS **boot menu** depending on the BIOS,
it could be [Del], [Esc], [F2], [F8] or [F12] key. The BIOS usually flashes
which key to press on your keyboard that allows you to access the BIOS setup
for the briefest of moments as you turn your PC computer on.

Once you are in the BIOS menu, you need to find the boot menu and bubble up the
USB disk where you copied Webconverger upon. Then Save & Exit, to boot
Webconverger every time you power on that machine.
