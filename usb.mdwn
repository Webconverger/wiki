.img [downloadable](http://download.webconverger.com/) files are USB images to be copied onto a USB stick/key.

## How to copy .img to USB stick (under Linux):

1. run root terminal (or normal terminal with "sudo su")
2. fdisk -l will list your USB drive - usually /dev/sdx ("x" representing letter like sda, sdb etc.), double check with `dmesg`
3. dd if=webconverger-image.img of=/dev/sdx

Detailed description on [Debian wiki](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive/Howto/USB). 

* Works only with newer computers
* Just as fast as a hard drive in many cases

[Kingston DataTravelers](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/1172362068/) are recommended, though almost any generic USB stick should be fine. Feel free to use the usb image also with embedded boards and Compact Flash cards (they behave like /dev/hda usually).

# Hacking the USB [[boot]]

Plug your Webconverger USB stick in and mount the USB stick, for e.g.:

	x61:~% sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb

Edit the menu.cfg. Alter elements like the [[homepage]].

	x61:/mnt/usb% sudo vim syslinux/menu.cfg

Unmount and boot up your system:

	x61:/mnt/usb% cd
	x61:~% sudo umount /mnt/usb

# Developer notes

In config/binary: 

	LH_BINARY_IMAGES="usb-hdd"

And `grub` doesn't work, so you must use the `syslinux` bootloader.
