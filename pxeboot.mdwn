# Mass cloning Webconverger, using [pxeboot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment)

Objective: Clone a Webconverger installation on a number of hard disks in a controlled LAN environment

Change the boot parameters as desired, following the instructions on
<http://webconverger.org/develop>. Create the isohybrid using the `offset`
option:


	isohybrid -offset 1 custom.iso


1. Dump the ISO on a harddisk using dd, e.g. `sudo if=binary-hybrid.iso of=/dev/sda` (warning: WIPES HARD DRIVE CONTENTS)

* Test your installation: you have now installed the base system to clone from.

* Download [Trinity Rescue Kit](http://trinityhome.org) and burn it on a CD or USB-stick, whatever you can boot your base system from.

* Boot the base system machine from the Trinity Rescue Kit, start the Netboot server and start the mclone tool in server mode.

* Boot all your other machines with pxeboot. This might be a little bit fiddling with the BIOS options. You'll see them registering on your netboot server.

* Press enter on any machine and the multicast copy starts.

In about 35 seconds (network speed, not number of clients dependant) all your machines are ready to use with Webconverger.
