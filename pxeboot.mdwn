Mass cloning webconverger, using pxeboot
========================================

Objective: clone a webconverger installation on a number of hard disks

* Change the boot parameters as desired, following the instructions on http://webconverger.org/develop/. Create the isohybrid using the -offset 1 option

> Example: isohybrid -offset 1 custom.iso

* Dump the iso on a harddisk using dd.

* Test your installation: you have now installed the base system to clone form.

* Download [Trinity Rescue Kit](http://trinityhome.org) and burn it on a CD or USB-stick, whatever you can boot your base system from.

* Boot the base system machine from the Trinity Rescue Kit, start the Netboot server and start the mclone tool in server mode.

* Boot all your other machines with pxeboot. This might be a little bit fiddling with the BIOS options. You'll see them registering on your netboot server.

* Press enter on any machine and the multicast copy starts. 

In about 35 seconds (network speed, not number of clients dependant) all your machines are ready to use with Webconverger.
