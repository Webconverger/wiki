Webconverger is designed to support **only** Web applications. Converging your
IT operations upon the Web frees your clients from [vendor
lock-in](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in).

Other operating systems often provide extra legacy software that simply is not
required for modern day pervasive Web computing. This extra unnecessary bloat
makes operating systems slow and harder to maintain.
