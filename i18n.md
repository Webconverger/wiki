We have excellent support for European languages and we will (re)address <abbr
title="Chinese, Japanese &amp; Korean">CJK</abbr> requirements given the demand
to do so.

# Choose your locale at boot

1. By using syslinux [boot](/boot/) menu **Languages**
2. Appending your locale by editing the syslinux boot menu, see [testing](/testing/) for a guide

# Once booted

3. By using the [customisation service](http://config.webconverger.com), filling in a form and purchasing a subscription or adding to your control panel

# i18n support falls into a couple of areas

1. Setting up the browser UI using `locale=` and using a single [ISO 639 code](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php)
2. Keyboard options using the `xkb=` mapping to **setxkbmap**, for example `xkb=-layout%20gb`. Spaces are URL encoded.
3. NOT SUPPORTED ATM: More complex <abbr title="Chinese, Japanese &amp; Korean">CJK</abbr> input methods

The first locale setting is also set in the Accept languages in the browser.
<https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc/live-config.sh#L194>

`xkb` replaces `keyboard-layouts=` from Debian Live and now gives you direct
and convienant access to
[setxkbmap](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=setxkbmap).

<https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/home/webc/webc.sh#L71> is how Webconverger parses and runs the option to `setxkbmap`.

In [debug mode](/boot/), this is how to setup a British keyboard and query its settings:

	$ setxkbmap -layout gb
	$ setxkbmap -query
	rules:      evdev
	model:      evdev
	layout:     gb
	options:    "grp:caps_toggle",grp:caps_toggle,ctrl:nocaps

To encode the argument string, simply launch a browser console and use the
Javascript function
[encodeURI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURI).
Or you can just replace spaces with `%20`.

	encodeURI("-layout gb")
	"-layout%20gb"

Which becomes `xkb=-layout%20gb` in your Webconverger configuration.

# Switching keyboard layouts

Try the default Arabic or Russian Language choices. Alt+Shift toggles between
latin based characters and the native language keyboard mapping.

You can switch keyboard layouts using customised special key combinations. For
example, in debug mode or in any Linux Xorg terminal:

	setxkbmap -layout us,th -option grp:shift_toggle

Allows you to toggle between US and Thai keyboard layouts by pressing both left
and right [SHIFT keys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_key) together.

To configure Webconverger with this preference, you append:

	xkb=-layout%20us,th%20-option%20grp:shift_toggle

Caveat: [Do not quote your commands](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/issues/25).

There are setxkbmap aliases which can be found in [/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst)
