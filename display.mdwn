# Manually setting up a monitor that isn't automatically setup

Sometimes
[EDID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_display_identification_data) is
not transmitted or is incorrect. Then you need to override the lack of EDID
information from the monitor and set the resolution accordingly.  This may
occur, for example, when using video extenders, splitters and the like, that
don't pass the [DDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Data_Channel)
out-of-band electrical signals that provide the EDID.  Removing pin 12 from one
of the ends of the VGA cable will achieve this as well.

When EDID is not received, the OS defaults to lower resolutions, such as
1024x768 and higher resolution modes are not available.  As a result, the
`xrandr-all` of the boot [[API]] is ineffective at setting resolutions.

Instead, we can use `xrandr` from the boot [[API]], but we need to do some
investigation in [[debug_mode|debug]] to get the video output names and the like and to
test things out.

## Manually adding the resolution and testing

To force a given resolution to a video output, we need to:

1. create the given resolution mode
* assign the resolution mode to the desired video output
* set the video mode for the given video output

### Create the given resolution mode
#
First, it's good to check the resolutions available:

    xrandr

Sample output:

    Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1024 x 768, maximum 8192 x 8192
    DVI-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    HDMI-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    VGA-0 connected 1024x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 0mm x 0mm
       1024x768       60.0*
       800x600        60.3     56.2
       848x480        60.0
       640x480        59.9

The computer in this example has three video outputs: `VGA-0`, `HDMI-0` and `DVI-0`, but only `VGA-0` is connected.  Make a note of the name of the video output name specific to your machine.

Let's say we want to add 720p resolution to the output `VGA-0` as we know that the display device supports it.  The resolution that we need (i.e. 1280x720) is not listed for the output `VGA-0` so we add it using `xrandr --newmode <Modeline>`.  We use [cvt](http://cvt.webconverger.com) to obtain the necessary modeline as follows:

    cvt 1280 720 60

or use the Web application version here: <http://cvt.webconverger.com/?x=1280&y=720&r=60>

Output:

    # 1280x720 59.86 Hz (CVT 0.92M9) hsync: 44.77 kHz; pclk: 74.50 MHz
    Modeline "1280x720_60.00"   74.50  1280 1344 1472 1664  720 723 728 748 -hsync +vsync

For the sake of consistency with existing modes, and to avoid the double quotes that may cause some problems parsing, we will substitute the mode name `"1280x720_60.00"` with `1280x720`.

Thus, to create a new resolution mode:

    xrandr --newmode 1280x720 74.50  1280 1344 1472 1664  720 723 728 748 -hsync +vsync

We can verify that the mode was created:

    xrandr

Sample output:

    Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1024 x 768, maximum 8192 x 8192
    DVI-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    HDMI-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    VGA-0 connected 1024x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 0mm x 0mm
       1024x768       60.0*
       800x600        60.3     56.2
       848x480        60.0
       640x480        59.9
      1280x720 (0x14f)   74.5MHz
            h: width  1280 start 1344 end 1472 total 1664 skew    0 clock   44.8KHz
            v: height  720 start  723 end  728 total  748           clock   59.9Hz

### Assign the resolution mode to the desired video output

    xrandr --addmode VGA-0 1280x720

Verify by running `xrandr`

Sample output:

    Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1024 x 768, maximum 8192 x 8192
    DVI-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    HDMI-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    VGA-0 connected 1024x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 0mm x 0mm
       1024x768       60.0*
       800x600        60.3     56.2
       848x480        60.0
       640x480        59.9
       1280x720       59.9

### Set the video mode to the desired resolution on the given output

    xrandr --output VGA-0 --mode 1280x720

## Using the Webconverger xrandr [[API]] to force a given resolution

The same steps as above need to be accomplished, so we pass three `xrandr` parameters at boot **in the correct order**:

720p resolution example:

    xrandr=--newmode%201280x720%2074.50%201280%201344%201472%201664%20720%20723%20728%20748%20-hsync%20%2Bvsync
    xrandr=--addmode%20VGA-0%201280x720
    xrandr=--output%20VGA-0%20--mode%201280x720

Notice: You can use <http://cvt.webconverger.com/?x=1280&y=720&r=60> to help calculate the first line.

1080p resolution example:

    xrandr=--newmode%201920x1080%20173.00%201920%202048%202248%202576%201080%201083%201088%201120%20-hsync%20%2Bvsync
    xrandr=--addmode%20VGA-0%201920x1080
    xrandr=--output%20VGA-0%20--mode%201920x1080

Note that in the second and third parameter you should substitute `VGA-0` for your specific output name obtained by running `xrandr`.  All three parameters above are to be appended in order to the boot parameters on one line, each separated by a space.
