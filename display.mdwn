# Manually setting up a monitor that isn't automatically setup

Sometimes
[EDID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_display_identification_data) is
not transmitted or incorrect. Then you need to override the lack of EDID
information from the monitor and set the resolution accordingly.  This may occur, for example, when using video extenders, splitters and the like, that don't pass the [DDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Data_Channel) out-of-band electrical signals that provide the EDID.

When EDID is not received, the OS defaults to lower resolutions, such as 1024x768 and higer resolution modes are not available.  As a result, the xrandr-all of the boot API is ineffective at setting resolutions.

To force a given resolution to a video output, we need to:

* create the given resolution mode
* add the resolution mode to the desired video output
* set the video mode for the given video output

###Create the given resolution mode
First, it's good to check the resolutions available:

    xrandr

Sample output:

    Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1024 x 768, maximum 8192 x 8192
    DVI-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    HDMI-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    VGA-0 connected 1024x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 0mm x 0mm
       1024x768       60.0* 
       800x600        60.3     56.2  
       848x480        60.0  
       640x480        59.9
