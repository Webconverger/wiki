# Manually setting up a monitor that isn't automatically setup

Sometimes
[EDID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_display_identification_data) is
not transmitted or incorrect. Then you need to override the lack of EDID
information from the monitor and set the resolution accordingly.  This may occur, for example, when using video extenders, splitters and the like, that don't pass the [DDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Data_Channel) out-of-band electrical signals that provide the EDID.

When EDID is not received, the OS defaults to lower resolutions, such as 1024x768 and higer resolution modes are not available.  As a result, the xrandr-all of the boot API is ineffective at setting resolutions.

To force a given resolution to a video output, we need to:

* create the given resolution mode
* add the resolution mode to the desired video output
* set the video mode for the given video output

###Create the given resolution mode
First, it's good to check the resolutions available:

    xrandr

Sample output:

    Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1024 x 768, maximum 8192 x 8192
    DVI-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    HDMI-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    VGA-0 connected 1024x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 0mm x 0mm
       1024x768       60.0* 
       800x600        60.3     56.2  
       848x480        60.0  
       640x480        59.9  

Let's say we want to add 720p resolution to the output `VGA-0` as we know that the display device supports it.  The resolution that we need (i.e. 1280x720) is not listed for the output `VGA-0` so we add it using `xrandr --newmode <Modeline>`.  We use `cvt` to obtain the necessary modeline as follows:

    cvt 1280 720 60

Output:

    # 1280x720 59.86 Hz (CVT 0.92M9) hsync: 44.77 kHz; pclk: 74.50 MHz
    Modeline "1280x720_60.00"   74.50  1280 1344 1472 1664  720 723 728 748 -hsync +vsync

For the sake of consistency with existing modes, and to avoid the double quotes that may cause some problems parsing, I will substitute the mode name `"1280x720_60.00"` with `1280x720`.

Thus, to create a new resolution mode:

    xrandr --newmode 1280x720 74.50  1280 1344 1472 1664  720 723 728 748 -hsync +vsync
