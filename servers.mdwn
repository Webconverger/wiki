# Bandwidth costs

Webconverger averages about [100 downloads a
day](http://dl.webconverger.com/stats/) and the ISO file is about 400M. So we
transfer about 40GB a day, or 1 Terabyte a month.

On [AWS S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/), transferring 1TB is ~122USD. 1024GB * $0.120 per GB = ~122USD

The annoying thing about Bitfolk/GPLhost is that you need to somehow buy your
bandwidth in advance and it can be tricky to predict.

We probably should think about setting up mirrors and reaching out to the community.
