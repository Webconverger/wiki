# Bandwidth costs

Webconverger averages about [100 downloads a
day](http://dl.webconverger.com/stats/) and the ISO file is about 400M. So we
transfer about 40GB a day, or 1 Terabyte a month.

On [AWS S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/), transferring 1TB is ~122USD. 1024GB * $0.120 per GB = ~122USD

The annoying thing about GPLhost is that you need to somehow buy your
bandwidth in advance and it can be tricky to predict.

We probably should think about setting up mirrors and reaching out to the community.

## Bandwidth

150GB pcm quota, goto Monitoring to see current use.

Extra is 12 USD (plus paypal fee) for 200 GB, and 24 USD for 400 GB, working
out to be **$0.06 per Gigabyte**. Half the cost of S3. However it's just for
that month! So it doesn't scale well at all.

Note that VPS will only turn off when you reach 120% of the allowed traffic.
