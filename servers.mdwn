DNS registration handled by Dreamhost.

DNS records hosted with [AWS Route 53](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/), this is mainly for DNS failover.

# Bandwidth costs

Webconverger averages about [100 downloads a
day](http://dl.webconverger.com/stats/) and the ISO file is about 400M. So we
transfer about 40GB a day, or 1 Terabyte a month.

# sg.webconverger.com

A [GPLHOST VPS package
4](https://dtc.node6503.gplhost.com/dtc/affiliation.php?affiliate=kaihendry&return=/hosting-vps.html)
Debian configured machine for development, hosted in Singapore.

* 30USD a month
* At least 50mbit/sec up and down for local traffic <http://www.gplhost.com/gplhost-network-singapore.html>
* [Control panel](https://dtc.node6503.gplhost.com/dtc/)
* [Printer configuration hosting](http://ppd.webconverger.com/)

## Bandwidth

150GB pcm quota, goto Monitoring to see current use.

Extra is 12 USD (plus paypal fee) for 200 GB, and 24 USD for 400 GB, working
out to be **$0.06 per Gigabyte**. Half the cost of S3. However it's just for
that month! So it doesn't scale well at all.

Note that VPS will only turn off when you reach 120% of the allowed traffic.
