# When Xorg 1.4.2 first boots it shows a squashed screen

# Workaround

One workaround is start X with another attached monitor. Then switch back to
the touchscreen. Now the display takes the full width. (?)

# Resolution detection bug?

I assumed it had to do with the screen resolution being mis-detected by Xorg.
However both images are reported being displayed by the monitor at 1024x768!

Any clues?
