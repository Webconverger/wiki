# When Xorg 7.3 first boots it shows a squashed screen

# Workaround

One workaround is start the screen in another screen. Then switch back to the
touchscreen. Now the display takes the full width.

# Resolution detection bug?

I assumed it had to do with the screen resolution being mis-detected by Xorg.
However both images are reported being displayed by the monitor at 1024x768!
Any clues?
