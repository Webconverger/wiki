# When Xorg 1.4.2 first boots it shows a squashed screen on a WinmateR15T63

# Workaround

One workaround is start X attached to a <a
href="../Dell1504FPaXorg.1.log">different Dell1504FP monitor</a>. Then switch
back to the touchscreen. Now the display takes the full width. (?)

# Resolution detection bug?

I assumed it had to do with the screen resolution being mis-detected by Xorg.
However both images are reported being displayed by the monitor at 1024x768!

However on closer inspection the <a href="../WinmateR15T630Xorg.1.log">WinmateR15T63 Xorg.log</a> shows

	(II) intel(0): Output VGA using initial mode 1280x768

Is that the problem?
