Currently there is a problem with [setting DNS from the BOOT parameter](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/2423f987dda9bf48/f1116a232525dbb7#f1116a232525dbb7)

Ideally Webconverger **should** be deployed in a **wired network** with a **DHCP
server**. 

Otherwise you could set a static IP manually (discouraged!):

       ip=IFACE,ADDRESS,NETMASK,GATEWAY[:IFACE,ADDRESS,NETMASK,GATEWAY]*
              Let  you  specify  the  name(s) and the options of the interface(s) that should be configured at
              boot time. Do not specify this if you want to use dhcp (default).


An example at the bootup prompt:

 live ip=eth0,192.168.1.22,255.255.255.0,192.168.1.1

* eth0 means the first interface (you won't need to change this usually)
* 192.168.1.22 is the IP address
* 255.255.255.0 is the netmask
* 192.168.1.1 is the gateway

If you really must setup the IP, `nonetworking` is better and more versatile approach to the problem.

# [[Wireless_networking|wireless]]

# Using `nonetworking`

By default a Debian live distro should use
[live-initramfs](http://git.debian.net/?p=debian-live/live-initramfs.git) to
setup
[networking](http://git.debian.net/?p=debian-live/live-initramfs.git;a=blob;f=scripts/live-bottom/23networking).
However the same can be achieved by
[interfaces](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=interfaces).

In [Webconverger the
interfaces](http://git.debian.org/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=blob;f=webconverger/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/network/interfaces)
assumes the eth0 is the wired connection and the eth1 or wlan0 interface is a
[[wireless]] interface. The wireless interface is configured by [wpa
supplicant](http://git.debian.org/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=blob;f=webconverger/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf).
By default it has a convienant, though perhaps a dangerous feature to join any
open wireless network.

If users are frankly too silly not to use DHCP, they need to setup a network by
the [interfaces](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=interfaces)
rules and manipulate typically
`webconverger/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/network/interfaces`. Let me
remind you that you must have `nonetworking` on your `config/binary`
LH_BOOTAPPEND_LIVE line for it to all work. For debugging an image with a
particular network setup, I suggest removing `nonetworking` to default to
live-initramfs's sensible wired DHCP defaults.
