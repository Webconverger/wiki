Ideally Webconverger **should** be deployed in a **wired network** with a
**DHCP server**, instead of a potentially unstable [[wireless]] connection.

Webconverger's default  [network/interfaces](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/network/interfaces)

* Allows hotplug of wired interfaces including [[USB_dongles|blog/entry/USB_tethering]]
* Configures a firewall with this [iptables configuration](https://github.com/Webconverger/Debian-Live-config/blob/master/webconverger/config/includes.chroot/etc/iptables.conf)

Please also see [[wireless]] and [[testing]].

### Overriding DNS via [[boot]]

Preferably you set this in your DHCPD, however you can override DNS for example for
[[filtering]] like so:

	dns=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4

This is implemented by [resolvconf script](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc/network-up.d/resolvconf)

### Overriding IP via [[boot]] command line

We defer to using [live-boot](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=live-boot) in this case.

	$ cat /proc/cmdline
	initrd=/live/initrd.img boot=live vga=771 video=vesa nomodeset splash quiet debug ip=eth0:10.0.0.1:10.0.0.254:255.255.255.0 BOOT_IMAGE=/live/vmlinuz

Notice `skipconfig` is removed and the `ip=` API is a little tricky.

	$ cat /etc/network/interfaces
	auto lo
	iface lo inet loopback

	allow-hotplug eth0
	iface eth0 inet static
		address 10.0.0.1
		netmask 10.0.0.254
		gateway 255.255.255.0

# Example of a static configuration customisation, for a [[build|develop]]

If deployments are frankly too silly not to use DHCP, you can configure static
IPs by configuring `/etc/network/interfaces`
like so:

	iface eth0 inet static
		   address 10.100.7.230
		   netmask 255.255.255.0
		   gateway 10.100.7.253

And the DNS:

	cat `/etc/resolv.conf
	nameserver 10.100.7.253
