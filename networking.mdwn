Ideally Webconverger **should** be deployed in a **wired network** with a
**DHCP server**, instead of a potentially unstable [[wireless]] connection.

Webconverger's default  [network/interfaces](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/network/interfaces)

* Allows hotplug of wired interfaces including [[USB_dongles|blog/entry/USB_tethering]]
* Configures a firewall with this [iptables configuration](https://github.com/Webconverger/Debian-Live-config/blob/master/webconverger/config/includes.chroot/etc/iptables.conf)

Please also see [[wireless]] and [[testing]].

# Example of a static configuration customisation

If deployments are frankly too silly not to use DHCP, you can configure static
IPs by configuring `/etc/network/interfaces`
like so:

	iface eth0 inet static
		   address 10.100.7.230
		   netmask 255.255.255.0
		   gateway 10.100.7.253

And the DNS:

	cat `/etc/resolv.conf
	nameserver 10.100.7.253
