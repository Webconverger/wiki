# Using `nonetworking` (static setups)

Ideally Webconverger **should** be deployed in a **wired network** with a
**DHCP server**.

By default a Debian live distro should use
[live-initramfs](http://git.debian.net/?p=debian-live/live-initramfs.git) to
setup
[networking](http://git.debian.net/?p=debian-live/live-initramfs.git;a=blob;f=scripts/live-bottom/23networking).
However the same can be achieved by
[interfaces](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=interfaces).

In recent versions of [Webconverger the
interfaces](http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=debian-live/config-webc.git;a=blob;f=webconverger/config/includes.chroot/etc/network/interfaces)
assumes the eth0 is the wired connection and the eth1 or wlan0 interface is a
[[wireless]] interface. The wireless interface is configured by [wpa
supplicant](http://git.webconverger.org/?p=webconverger-base;a=blob;f=debian/webconverger.init;)
during init.

If users are frankly too silly not to use DHCP, they need to setup a network by
the [interfaces](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=interfaces)
rules and manipulate typically
`webconverger/config/includes.chroot/etc/network/interfaces`. Let me
remind you that you must have `nonetworking` on your `config/binary`
`LH_BOOTAPPEND_LIVE` line for it to all work. For debugging an image with a
static network setup, I suggest removing `nonetworking` to default to
live-initramfs's sensible wired DHCP defaults.

# Example of a static configuration customisation

`webconverger/config/includes.chroot/etc/network/interfaces` would read:

	iface eth0 inet static
		   address 10.100.7.230
		   netmask 255.255.255.0
		   gateway 10.100.7.253

And the DNS:

	cat webconverger/config/includes.chroot/etc/resolv.conf
	nameserver 10.100.7.253
