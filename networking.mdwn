Currently there is a problem with [setting DNS from the BOOT parameter](http://groups.google.com/group/webc-users/browse_thread/thread/2423f987dda9bf48/f1116a232525dbb7#f1116a232525dbb7)


Ideally Webconverger should be deployed in a **wired network** with a **DHCP server**.

Otherwise you can set the IP manually:

       ip=IFACE,ADDRESS,NETMASK,GATEWAY[:IFACE,ADDRESS,NETMASK,GATEWAY]*
              Let  you  specify  the  name(s) and the options of the interface(s) that should be configured at
              boot time. Do not specify this if you want to use dhcp (default).


An example at the bootup prompt:

 live ip=eth0,192.168.1.22,255.255.255.0,192.168.1.1

* eth0 means the first interface (you won't need to change this usually)
* 192.168.1.22 is the IP address
* 255.255.255.0 is the netmask
* 192.168.1.1 is the gateway

Non-standard network (wireless) setups can be [customised](http://webconverger.com/buy) as a service of [Webconverger.com](http://webconverger.com/).

# Wireless hardware

Please purchase [Linux compatible wireless hardware](http://www.linuxemporium.co.uk/products/wireless/). Else making your wireless work with Webconverger will be very difficult!

Other wireless chipsets known to work:

* ipw3945
* ipw2200
* ipw2100
* rt2x00
* rt2570

## Getting a Windows wireless device working

Get the Win32 drivers:

    x40:~/webc/wifi% ls
    ar5523.bin  ar5523.sys  net5523.cat  net5523.inf

Prime your chroot:

    sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper-common ndiswrapper-utils ndiswrapper-source

Build the ndiswrapper module for your distribution and architecture:

    m-a prepare
    m-a a-i ndiswrapper

With any luck, you'll have made a Debian package, e.g. /usr/src/ndiswrapper-modules-2.6.22-2-686_1.47-2+2.6.22-4_i386.deb

Install that package. You want that in your `config/chroot_local-packages`.

Configure your (chroot) system for the device

    sudo ndiswrapper -i net5523.inf
    sudo ndiswrapper -l
    sudo ndiswrapper -m
