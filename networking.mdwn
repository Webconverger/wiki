Ideally Webconverger should be deployed in a network with a **DHCP server**.

Otherwise you can set the IP using initramfs's functionality:

       ip=IFACE,ADDRESS,NETMASK,GATEWAY[:IFACE,ADDRESS,NETMASK,GATEWAY]*
              Let  you  specify  the  name(s) and the options of the interface(s) that should be configured at
              boot time. Do not specify this if you want to use dhcp (default).


An example at the bootup prompt:

 live ip=eth0,192.168.1.22,255.255.255.0,192.168.1.1

* eth0 means the first interface (you won't need to change this usually)
* 192.168.1.22 is the IP address
* 255.255.255.0 is the netmask
* 192.168.1.1 is the gateway
