Ideally Webconverger **should** be deployed in a **wired network** with a
**DHCP server**, instead of a potentially unstable [[wireless]] connection.

Webconverger's default  [network/interfaces](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/network/interfaces)

* Allows hotplug of wired interfaces including [[USB_dongles|blog/entry/USB_tethering]]
* Configures a firewall with this [iptables configuration](https://github.com/Webconverger/Debian-Live-config/blob/master/webconverger/config/includes.chroot/etc/iptables.conf)

Please also see [[wireless]] and [[testing]].

### Overriding DNS via [[API]]

Preferably you set this in your DHCPD, however you can override DNS for example for
[[filtering]] like so:

	dns=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4

This is implemented by [resolvconf script](https://github.com/Webconverger/webc/blob/master/etc/webc/network-up.d/resolvconf)

### Static IP networking via [[boot]] command line on the Live version

We defer to using
[live-boot](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=live-boot) in this
case. This is unsupported on the Install version currently.

	boot=live ip=10.0.0.1::10.0.0.254:255.255.255.0::

Notice `skipconfig` is removed and the `ip=` API is a little tricky(!)
