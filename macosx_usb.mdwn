1. Download the latest official Webconverger from
<http://dl.webconverger.com/latest.iso> The download file will be
renamed to the latest ISO, at the time of writing `webc-13.0.iso`.

2. Open a Terminal in `/Applications/Utilities/`

3. Run `diskutil list` to get the current list of devices

4. Insert your flash media

5. Run `diskutil list` again and determine the device node assigned to
your flash media (e.g. /dev/disk4)

6. Run `diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN` (replace N with the disk
number from the last command; in the previous example, N would be 4)
**Note**: this will wipe all information you have on the selected disk.
So be very careful to note the correct device node assigned to your
thumbdrive

7. Execute `sudo dd if=/path/to/downloaded.img of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m`
(replace "/path/to/downloaded.img" with the path where the desired
file is located).

A path is where the desired file is stored on your computer. To find
the path to the downloaded file, open Finder to locate the file,
select the file and right click. Then select "Get Info." In the
pop-out window, you should be able to see a field called "Where." It
should look something like "/Users/NameofAccount/Downloads"

So for example, what you should type into Terminal, where the desired
file is webc-13.0.iso, and the device node assigned to your thumbdrive
is 4:

`sudo dd if=/Users/NameofAccount/Downloads/webc-13.0.iso of=/dev/rdisk4 bs=1m`

Terminal may prompt you for an admin password if you have set one up.  When you
key in your password, it does not show up on the Terminal, so be careful to
type it correctly once and hit enter.

While copying, Terminal does not show any progress bar and looks like
it's doing nothing. Wait until it displays the transfer message.

Finally **step 8** Run `diskutil eject /dev/diskN` and remove your flash media when
the command completes.
