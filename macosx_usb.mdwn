1. Download the desired file from <http://download.webconverger.com/latest.iso>
The download file will be renamed to the latest ISO, at the time of writing
`webc-12.2.iso`.

2. Open a Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities/)

3. Run "diskutil list" to get the current list of devices

4. Insert your flash media

5. Run "diskutil list" again and determine the device node assigned to
your flash media (e.g. /dev/disk2)

6. Run "diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN" (replace N with the disk
number from the last command; in the previous example, N would be 2)
*Note**: this will wipe all information you have on the selected disk.
So be very careful to note the correct device node assigned to your
thumbdrive

7. Execute "sudo dd if=/path/to/downloaded.img of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m"
(replace "/path/to/downloaded.img" with the path where the desired
file is located).

A path is where the desired file is stored on your computer. To find the path
to the downloaded file, open Finder to locate the file, select the file and
right click. Then select "Get Info." In the pop-out window, you should be able
to see a field called "Where." It should look something like
"/Users/NameofAccount/Downloads"

So for example, what you should type into Terminal, where the desired
file is webc-12.2.iso, and the device node assigned to
your thumbdrive is 2:

	sudo dd if=/Users/NameofAccount/Downloads/webc-12.2.iso of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=1m

If you see the error dd: Invalid number `1m', you are using GNU dd.
Use the same command but replace "bs=1m" with "bs=1M".

8. Run "diskutil eject /dev/diskN" and remove your flash media when
the command completes
